About Us 
About Us	About Us:	Latin American Foundation for the Future (LAFF) is a UK-registered charity working with	local organisations in Peru that support vulnerable children in the region of Cusco. Due to poverty, family violence, homelessness and teenage pregnancy amongst other factors, many children in Peru are lacking opportunities to access basic rights such as education and equal participation in society. LAFF chooses a collaborative approach, partnering with local organisations to reach out to these children and young people, helping them to build a brighter future for themselves.	LAFF’s team is based in Cusco and currently supports	three partner organisations	and over 100 young people in Cusco and across the Sacred Valley region. LAFF is also a part of the ‘Semilla Nueva’ Network of NGOs in Cusco – the members of which collaborate to improve the working environment for charities operating in the Cusco region.	Our Vision:	We envision a Latin America where	all	children and young people have full support in accessing	quality education	and	equal life opportunities	.	Our Mission:	We work with local partners to improve our long-term ability to provide	quality education	and	personal development	to children and young people in vulnerable conditions in Peru.	Our History:	LAFF was founded in 2008 by Sarah Oakes in response to her experience working in Cusco and witnessing the harsh reality of life for vulnerable youth in Latin America.	Partnership has always been central to our work, as our organisation was created around the initial goal to raise funds for a member of the local community to establish a home to support children living on the streets. After an overwhelming response from supporters in the UK, Sarah saw the potential to improve the future of vulnerable youth in the Cusco region through long-term partnerships with local organisations.	Since 2008, LAFF has worked with different partners in the Cusco region responding to specific challenges, including:	Homelessness	Youth pregnancy	Gender discrimination	Lack of opportunities and infrastructure in rural communities	Indigenous cultural erasure	Our Values:	OUR TEAM	TRUSTEES	LAFF COMMUNITY	I would say the most important thing to do is to prepare for	Dissertationowl	how specifically you would fit in and lead at stern.

Partners 
Partners	Our Partnership Model	LAFF gives children and homes in Peru the tools and skills they need to build a more independent future. We provide educational and vocational training support for vulnerable youth, and support organisational sustainability through income generation, cost reduction initiatives and capacity building for staff.	LAFF has an in-depth selection process to choose its partners carefully. To ensure that we have maximum impact, we work hard to find partners who share the same values as us, are open and transparent about their needs, strengths and weaknesses, as well as their finances, so that we can help them to the best of our ability.	Once selected, we work closely with partners to identify their needs and challenges, so that we can work on them together. As well as providing grants to support sustainability or education initiatives at the home, we also provide tailored needs-based capacity building support to the staff of the home, so that the organisation can become stronger and more independent in future.	We monitor and evaluate the progress of any projects we have supported, so that both the organisations and LAFF can learn from them. We conduct regular reviews of our partnerships to ensure they are meeting our objectives and the needs of the organisations and children.

==============================
Casa Mantay
Casa Mantay	Opening its doors in 2000, Casa Mantay is a safe house that provides shelter, food and education for young mothers between the ages of 12 and 18.	Coming from troubled backgrounds, many of these vulnerable girls have been victims of sexual abuse, neglect and violence. Casa Mantay aims to empower them, offering them the support they need to live as strong, independent members of society, capable of taking care of themselves and their children.	An essential part of this work takes place in the Taller Mantay, the organisation’s workshop, which provides the girls with training for four hours a day and generates jobs for women who have already left the Casa. Authentic Peruvian leather accessories are made and then sold in Palacio del Inka in Cusco. Casa Mantay also built an innovative Social Enterprise project, ‘Arte Floral’, which teaches the girls how to create a range of decorative flower arrangements. These arrangements are often sold at weddings & luxury 5 star hotels.	‘Experiencia Mantay’, is the latest, unique social enterprise, which is aimed at tourists to educate them about Casa Mantay. It begins with a guided tour and background explanation of the organisation. Afterwards, a presentation on the Taller Mantay is given, and then the tourists have the opportunity to create their own, completely personalised and individual, keyring.	The main objectives of these social enterprises are to facilitate the training and eventual economic independence of the mothers in the company of their children. Additionally, the profits generated from these sales go towards buying supplies, paying the salaries of the workshop employees and contribute towards the running costs of Casa Mantay.	By providing a helping hand, free from judgement or discrimination, Casa Mantay is helping lift the women of Peru out of poverty and allowing them to become upstanding and valuable citizens.	mantay.org	How LAFF Helps	Quality Education	Formal Education:	LAFF financially supports Casa Mantay to ensure that all mothers and children have access to formal education and/or vocational training, with all the materials and resources needed to attend school. Through this, LAFF aims to have 100% of girls passing their exams each year. LAFF also provides after school tutors to Casa Mantay to improve the girls’ quality of education.	Personal Development:	Financial education: LAFF supports the financial education of the girls at Casa Mantay by providing a series of group workshops by an expert volunteer on savings, taxes, health insurance, and independent life, to increase their autonomy and independence going into adult life. Furthermore, LAFF ensures that  100% of girls have been assessed for cognitive learning disabilities and correctly diagnosed, thus being able to tailor education based on their individual needs. This means the girls are able to  reach their full potential in their academic goals without any setbacks.	Capacity Building	Organisational Capacity Building:	LAFF has supported Casa Mantay in the creation of a Strategic and Annual Plan with clear indicators and objectives for Casa Mantay for 2020 onwards. This allows Casa Mantay to develop and possibly expand their current programs, and plan future ones. Furthermore, LAFF provides technical support to improve Casa Mantay’s Monitoring and Evaluation systems, including documentation, and provides sessions on M&E consultancy. This allows Casa Mantay to gain expertise in monitoring and evaluating programs, so they are able to use knowledge to prepare future programs and monitor current ones.	Financial Sustainability:	LAFF has helped Casa Mantay by creating a fundraising plan based on its budget projection for 2020. This means Casa Mantay will have increased annual revenue contributing to long term financial sustainability. Furthermore, LAFF has helped create a plan to set up an emergency fund for unexpected urgent needs, in the hope that Casa Mantay will have enough funds to provide for all program, maintenance and emergency costs as well as be able to expand on existing programs when needed.	*	These programmes are ongoing and subject to change depending on the needs of our partner organisations. Unfortunately due to the COVID-19 crisis, many of these projects have had to be put on hold. We endeavour to implement these projects as soon as possible.

Sacred Valley Project
Sacred Valley Project	The Sacred Valley Project was set up in 2009 with the aim of providing access to education for indigenous girls from the highlands of Peru.	Convinced that education is the most successful route to empowerment, the project does everything it can to offer these girls a safe learning environment, accommodation and nutritious meals. Currently, the project has two dormitories located in Calca & Ollantaytambo and supports 47 young girls. LAFF’s role within the Sacred Valley Project is to support the tuition and transport costs of the two dormitories. LAFF also assists the houses in Calca & Ollantaytambo to be able to fundraise for more sustainable energy sources, such as the solar water heater.	Perhaps one of the greatest challenges these girls face is low self-esteem, which usually manifests itself in excessive shyness. Part of the Sacred Valley Project’s work is to boost the confidence of each of these young women, so they can begin to enjoy and take a more interactive role in their own education. It provides a space that nurtures and supports indigenous girls in their endeavour to adapt to the culture of an urban area, and implements a long term academic and personal development curriculum that is relevant to their culture, communities and personal goals.	sacredvalleyproject.org	How LAFF Helps	Quality Education	Formal Education:	LAFF financially supports SVP to ensure that all girls have access to formal education, with all the materials and resources they need to attend school, so that 100% of beneficiaries have passing school grades at the end of the school year. Furthermore, LAFF also finances 8 after school tutors to SVP to improve the girls’ quality of education and attend at least 4 professional development workshops, to prepare them for adult life.	Personal Development:	LAFF supports the financial education of the girls at SVP by providing a series of group workshops by an expert volunteer on savings, taxes, health insurance, and independent life, to increase their autonomy and independence going into adult life. Furthermore, LAFF ensures that  100% of girls have been assessed for cognitive learning disabilities and correctly diagnosed, thus being able to tailor education based on their individual needs. This means the girls are able to  reach their full potential in their academic goals without any setbacks. Finally, LAFF provides 2 general visits to the dentist for every girl living at SVP, including transportation.	Capacity Building	Organisational Capacity Building:	LAFF is helping SVP to develop an Annual Work Plan and associated calendar with set evaluation tools (eg. surveys, interviews, tutor monthly reports) to be scheduled for each project in the annual calendar. This means SVP will be able to use the Annual Plan to seamlessly see through programs and plan out activities for the following year, as well as being able to monitor the progress of all activities with an up to date calendar. Furthermore, LAFF is helping to compile a record of all beneficiaries documents, including medical records and school reports, so thay have quick and easy access to vital information when needed.	Financial Sustainability:	LAFF assists SVP by increasing revenue sources annually and expanding on their sources of donations. LAFF does this by completing financial audits as well as creating a financial plan for the year. This means SVP will have an increased revenue and therefore greater long term financial sustainability.	*	These programmes are ongoing and subject to change depending on the needs of our partner organisations. Unfortunately due to the COVID-19 crisis, many of these projects have had to be put on hold. We endeavour to implement these projects as soon as possible.

Mosqoy
Mosqoy	Focusing its attention on Peru’s indigenous Quechua community, Mosqoy gives these marginalised people the voice they so desperately need.	Since its birth in 2006, the organisation has aimed to help the Quechua people preserve their culture whilst simultaneously offering them the chance to be a part of modern Peru. They have two main programmes which focus on education and enterprise and help to raise the Quechua people out of poverty so they can enjoy a better quality of life.	The T’ikary Youth Program, provides educational opportunities for young people from rural highland Quechua communities to further their education while strengthening ties with their communities and their cultural heritage. The programme assists post-secondary students by sponsoring their studies at tertiary institutions in Cusco. Students are provided with a dormitory-style residence and, in exchange, they participate in fundraising events and volunteer service projects, to contribute to the education of future scholarship students. The goal is that T’ikary will not only assist current students but will also become a self-sustaining system of education whereby the trend shifts towards an upward cycle of prosperity, resilience and autonomy.	The Q’ente Society Textile Revitalization Programme works directly with hundreds of weaving cooperatives based in the Sacred Valley (most of whom are female) and gives them an outlet to sell their textiles to North America. This connects women’s often unacknowledged labour with a fair income source, fostering financial independence in their families, greater provision for their children, and a central, respected place in the rural economy. Furthermore, it renews cultural pride and enhances the perceived worth of textiles in both Quechua and non-Quechua communities.	Mosqoy also supports sustainable tourism through their Field School, in which they offer Canadians the opportunity to become more conscious & responsible when travelling. They encourage travellers to understand their impact on the communities they visit while inspiring them to think compassionately and critically about international development issues. They aim to support local reputable businesses and learn from community members about their culture, with 100% of the profits returning to local community members & Mosqoy’s charitable programs.	Having suffered marginalisation and social and economic hardship, Mosqoy is helping the Quechua community overcome their difficulties. The end goal is to have everyone in Peru on an equal footing, regardless of his or her background.	www.mosqoy.org	How LAFF Helps	Quality Education	Formal Education:	LAFF financially supports Mosqoy to ensure that Silvia, one of the Mosqoy students, has access to English and IT classes, in the hope that Silvia will graduate from Khipu University in these subjects.	Personal Development:	LAFF supports the financial education of the young people at Mosqoy by organising a series of group workshops by an expert volunteer on savings, taxes, health insurance, and independent life, to increase their autonomy and independence going into adult life. Furthermore, LAFF plans to deliver a series of workshops on sexual education for young men and women at Mosqoy so they have greater awareness of health issues and their own bodies, leading to higher self-confidence and improved reproductive health.	Capacity Building	Organisational Capacity Building:	LAFF primarily provides technical support to improve Mosqoy’s HR programme. LAFF will conduct sessions with Mosqoy on  volunteer recruitment – discussing which recruitment channels to use and sharing LAFF’s recruitment experience, as well as compiling a volunteer database. This means Mosqoy will have implemented an HR strategy that is efficient, recruiting all desired volunteer positions within a reasonable timeframe. Furthermore, LAFF is aiming to recruit a volunteer who specialises in Human Resources to guide Mosqoy. This means Mosqoy will gain expertise in Human Resources, leading to greater recruiting efficiency in the future.	Financial Sustainability:	Alongside Mosqoy’s recruitment volunteer, LAFF is aiming to recruit a  fundraising volunteer to implement Mosqoy’s fundraising plan.	As a result, Mosqoy will have increased revenue of up to 10% per year and improved financial health and sustainability.	*	These programmes are ongoing and subject to change depending on the needs of our partner organisations. Unfortunately due to the COVID-19 crisis, many of these projects have had to be put on hold. We endeavour to implement these projects as soon as possible.

Staff and Volunteers
Staff and Volunteers	Staff	Amapola Pino Cruzado – Partnerships Manager	Born in Cusco, Peru, one of the experiences that marked her life was at the age of 19 when she began to participate in volunteer work with children and adolescents, these experiences changed the way she had understood the world until then and how she wanted to contribute as a person. She has a bachelor’s degree in law and wants to continue learning and contributing in the field of human rights and social inclusion. She thinks that from each of our spaces we should build a safe world of opportunities for children and be adults who respect them and whom they can trust.	Nació en Cusco, Perú, una de las experiencias que marcó su vida fue a los 19 años cuando empezó a participar en voluntariados dirigidos a niños, niñas y adolescentes, estas experiencias le cambiaron la forma de cómo hasta entonces había entendido el mundo y de cómo ella quería contribuir como persona. Es bachiller en derecho y quiere seguir aprendiendo y contribuir en el campo de derechos humanos e inclusión social. Piensa que desde cada uno de nuestros espacios construyamos un mundo seguro y de oportunidades para la niñez y seamos adultos que los respeten y en los cuales puedan confiar.	Carol Zavaleta – Development Manager	Hola! I’m Carol, a world wanderer Limeña. A lawyer by profession, but at heart passionate about facilitating resources for communities in need. In San Francisco, I worked with immigrant communities in vulnerable situations, focusing on providing them with access to educational resources. Through workshops and community programs, we connected families with learning opportunities and provided guidance for accessing formal education.	My approach has always been to create spaces where these families can overcome language and cultural barriers and access the resources they need to improve their quality of life. Watching them grow stronger and achieve new educational opportunities has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.	I’m very excited to begin this journey with LAFF, collaborating together on this great project.	¡Hola! Soy Carol, una limeña trotamundos. De profesión abogada, pero de corazón apasionada por la facilitación de recursos a comunidades en necesidad. En San Francisco, trabajé con comunidades inmigrantes en situaciones de vulnerabilidad, enfocándome en ofrecerles facilidades para acceder a recursos educativos. A través de talleres y programas comunitarios, se logró conectar a las familias con oportunidades de aprendizaje, brindando orientación para acceder a la educación formal.	Mi enfoque siempre ha sido crear espacios donde estas familias puedan superar las barreras lingüísticas y culturales, y acceder a los recursos que necesitan para mejorar su calidad de vida. Ver cómo se fortalecen y alcanzan nuevas oportunidades educativas ha sido una de las experiencias más gratificantes de mi carrera.	Estoy muy emocionada de empezar esta aventura en LAFF, colaborando en este gran proyecto juntos.	Full-time Volunteers	Thomas Martynowicz – Fundraising Coordinator	Hello!

Here in Cusco, I’m excited to support LAFF’s mission as a Fundraising Coordinator while also studying the Quechua language.	¡Hola! Me llamo Thomas, y soy de los Estados Unidos. Recientemente, me gradué de una Licenciatura en Relaciones Internacionales y una Maestría en Estudios de Derecho.

Rose Cartwright – Coordinator of Events & Campaigns	Hi! I’m Rosie from the UK. I’m currently studying modern languages at Durham University and am grateful to become part of the team at LAFF as part of my year abroad. Working with LAFF will be a wonderful opportunity to combine improving my Spanish with my interest in international development, learning from the amazing work done locally in Cusco. With lots of interest but little experience in this sector, hopefully my time spent with this organisation and its partners will inspire me to pursue a similar career after university. Thank you LAFF for this opportunity to work with you in beautiful Peru!	¡Hola! Soy Rosie del Reino Unido. Actualmente estudio los idiomas modernos en la Universidad de Durham y estoy agradecida de formar parte del equipo de LAFF como parte de mi año en el extranjero.

Con mucho interés pero poca experiencia en este sector, espero que el tiempo que pase con esta organización y sus socios me inspiren a seguir una carrera similar después de la universidad. ¡Gracias a LAFF por esta oportunidad de trabajar con ustedes en el hermoso Peru!	Jonas Zoellner	– Projects Coordinator	Hallo, or as you would say in my area – Gude! My name is Jonas, and I’m	from Frankfurt, Germany. I’ve always believed in the power of education to create pathways for those who might not otherwise have the chance. My experiences working as a paramedic and with refugees have deepened my commitment to supporting marginalised and disadvantaged groups, driving me to work towards initiatives that can genuinely transform lives. I’m grateful for the chance to contribute to LAFF’s meaningful work here in	Cusco. I look forward to learning from this vibrant community, rediscovering the incredible Andean cuisine and landscapes I’ve come to love, and playing my part in making a difference.	¡Hallo, o como dirían en mi región – Gude! Me llamo Jonas y soy de Frankfurt, Alemania. Siempre he creído en el poder de la educación para crear oportunidades para aquellos que de otra manera no las tendrían. Mis experiencias trabajando como paramédico y con refugiados han profundizado mi compromiso de apoyar a grupos marginados y	desfavorecidos, impulsándome a trabajar en iniciativas que puedan transformar vidas genuinamente. Estoy agradecido por la oportunidad de contribuir al importante trabajo de LAFF aquí en Cusco. Espero con ansias aprender de esta vibrante comunidad, redescubrir la increíble cocina y paisajes andinos que he llegado a amar, y poner de mi parte para hacer la diferencia.	Andrea Holgado	– Communication & Projects Coordinator	Hi! My name is Andrea. I am a psychologist by profession and a textile artist by trade. I was born in Lima, into a large family that migrated from Andahuaylas. Throughout my life, I have been deeply in love with the diverse Andean and Amazonian landscapes of Peru, and I have felt a strong commitment to the development and inclusion of rural communities that are often overlooked by the State. After my experiences in the field, I am convinced that access to quality education is the foundation for creating opportunities and breaking the cycle of material poverty. My dream and goal is to dedicate myself to social impact projects that help improve the living conditions of people in vulnerable contexts. I am excited to join the LAFF team here in Cusco and am looking forward to adopting this new lifestyle while learning Quechua and traditional weaving techniques.	¡Hola! Mi nombre es Andrea. Psicóloga de profesión y artista textil de oficio. Nací en Lima, en la cuna de una extensa familia que migró de Andahuaylas. Toda mi vida me la he pasado enamorada de los diversos paisajes andinos y amazónicos del Perú y he sentido un profundo compromiso con el desarrollo e inclusión de comunidades rurales a las que el Estado les falla cada día. Luego de las experiencias que he tenido en el ámbito comunitario, estoy convencida que el acceso a educación de calidad es la base para la creación de oportunidades y para cortar con el ciclo de la pobreza material. Mi sueño y meta es dedicarme a proyectos de impacto social que contribuyan a mejorar las condiciones de vida de personas en contextos vulnerables. Estoy emocionada de sumarme al equipo de LAFF acá en el Cusco y espero con ilusión adaptarme a este nuevo estilo de vida, mientras aprendo Quechua y técnicas tradicionales de tejido.	Haittie Foden-Ellis	– Fundraising Coordinator	¡Hola! Soy Hattie, tengo 18 años y soy del Reino Unido. Recién terminé la escuela y antes de la universidad, espero experimentar la cultura peruana y mejorar mi español. LAFF realmente me atrajo debido a su fuerte enfoque feminista y la intimidad del trabajo de la organización benéfica con la gente de la comunidad. Estoy muy agradecido por el papel de Coordinador de Recaudación de Fondos y estoy emocionada por nuestros tres meses juntos en el impresionante Cusco.	Hi! I’m Hattie – an 18 year old from the UK.

Trustees	Chiara Minigutti	Trustee with Special Responsibility for People	Chiara is Italian, from the city of Genoa, and first travelled to Peru in 2015, when she applied to volunteer with LAFF as the Vocational Training and Career Guidance Coordinator. During this 6 month placement she fell in love with both Cusco and the work LAFF does in Peru! Luckily for her, a paid position with LAFF opened right at the end of her placement and she became the LAFF Programme Manager in 2015/2016. This year full of new experiences, challenges and amazing people convinced her to continue supporting LAFF once back in Europe, this time as a Trustee, with special responsibility for People. She is, therefore, looking after our wonderful international team of volunteers, monitoring and adapting our recruitment, management, and retention strategies. Chiara is currently living in the beautiful city of Barcelona, in Spain. She has been working in a sustainable tourism start-up and is now investing most of her time and efforts into a recently founded Italian charity,	Ayni Cooperazione	, working remotely.	Chiara es de Italia, de la ciudad de Genoa, y viajó por primera vez a Perú en 2015, cuando mandó su aplicación a LAFF para el rol de coordinador de formación profesional y orientación profesional. Durante su colocación en prácticas, se enamoró de Cuzco y del trabajo de LAFF en Perú. Con mucha suerte, al final de su seis meses, hubo una oportunidad pagada con LAFF y entonces se convirtió en la Gerente de Programas en el 2015/16. Este año lleno de nuevas experiencias, retos y personas increíbles la convencieron de continuar su apoyo para la organización cuando llegó en Europa, ahora como miembra del consejo directivo de LAFF, con la responsabilidad especial de Recursos Humanos. Chiara cuida de nuestro equipo maravilloso de voluntarios internacionales, la supervisión y adaptación de la contratación, la gestión y las estrategias de retención.	Actualmente Chiara  trabaja para una nueva empresa de turismo sostenible y dedica la mayoría de sus esfuerzos en una nueva organización benéfica italiana, Ayni Cooperazione, trabajando de manera remota. Le encanta caminar, leer, y la fotografía.	Thomas Pickford	Trustee with Special Responsibility for Fundraising	Thomas first joined LAFF as a Programme Coordinator in the summer of 2019. He spent four months volunteering with the team, helping to plan and write the new five-year strategy for the organisation, as well as managing the day-to-day programmes with LAFF’s partners. He loved his time in Cusco so much and was so inspired by LAFF’s work with its partners that he decided to continue supporting remotely once he moved back to London. Thomas worked with other previous volunteers to organise a LAFF Christmas Salsa party for Christmas 2019 before officially taking over the role of fundraising trustee from Sarah Warry in the new year. As fundraising trustee, he hopes to be able to increase LAFF’s resources so that it can continue its important work, and expand to reach even more young people in the Cusco area. Thomas has experience volunteering for other NGOs in London, working in the fields of fundraising and communications for NGOs in London and Spain. He currently works as a project assistant at a social impact consultancy company in London.	Thomas se unió a LAFF en el verano de 2019 como coordinador de programas. Pasó cuatro meses como voluntario en el equipo, ayudando a planear y a escribir la nueva estrategia de cinco años para la organización, además de gestionar los programas diarios con los socios de LAFF. Thomas amó tanto su tiempo en Cuzco y se sintió tan motivado por el trabajo de LAFF con sus socios, que decidió continuar apoyando la organización de manera remota una vez que se volvió a Londres. Thomas, junto con otros voluntarios previos, organizó una fiesta de salsa de LAFF, durante la navidad en 2019, antes de integrarse al consejo directivo de LAFF . En su nuevo papel, espera poder aumentar los recursos disponibles a LAFF para que pueda continuar su importante labor, y expandirse para mejorar las vidas de aún más jóvenes en la región de Cuzco.	Thomas tiene más experiencia como voluntario en otros ONGs en Londres y en España. Actualmente trabaja como un asistente de proyectos en una consultora especializada en impacto social en Londres.	Clarice Benney	Trustee with Special Responsibility for Communications	Clarice formed part of the LAFF team in 2020-21, first as Communications Coordinator and then as Programmes Coordinator. As this was during the pandemic, Clarice was working remotely for the majority of her time, but was able to get in a few months in Cusco and meet our partners in-person. Clarice’s work involved developing the communications campaign for LAFF’s first “Big Give” and several collaborative projects with other NGOs working in Cusco. Clarice returned to the UK to complete her degree in Spanish and now works in research  community engagement in Cambridge. As communications trustee, Clarice works with coordinators to ensure that LAFF’s organisational brand is consistent across all communications channels and aims to boost LAFF’s profile by expanding our network of media partners.“I really believe in the sustainable partnership model LAFF employs for its programmes and I think that a similar ethos is essential for digital communications. Partnering with other organisations allows us to put LAFF’s work in context and showcase our expertise – working on the ground in Cusco for over 15 years!”	Clarice formó parte del equipo de LAFF en 2020-21, primero como Coordinadora de Comunicaciones y luego como Coordinadora de Programas. Como esto fue durante la pandemia, Clarice estuvo trabajando de forma remota durante la mayor parte de su tiempo, pero pudo llegar unos meses a Cusco y conocer a nuestras organizaciones asociadas en persona. El trabajo de Clarice involucró el desarrollo de la campaña de comunicaciones para el primer “Big Give” de LAFF y varios proyectos de colaboración con otras ONG que trabajan en Cusco. Clarice regresó al Reino Unido para completar su licenciatura en español y ahora trabaja en la participación de la comunidad de investigación en Cambridge.

Interview with Photography artist (Empower Andean Arts campaign)- Ninoska Montúfar Becerra	Ninoska is a photographer based in Cusco.	What inspired you to create your art?	Since I was a child I have always felt a huge love for my culture and the traditions of my land, Sicuani, in Cusco. I think there is something very special about being able to capture those moments, colours and landscapes that are part of our identity. Photography became my way of sharing that beauty with the world, of saving and transmitting the essence of who we are. For me, each photo is a way to honour and preserve everything that makes us unique.	Who taught you your art and what does this relationship mean to you?	The truth is that I have learned photography self-taught. I started taking photographs with my cell phone, and little by little I have been getting better photographic equipment, I have been exploring, trying and making mistakes until I found my own style. Every photo I take is an opportunity to improve and better understand what I want to convey. For me, this way of learning has been very special because it has allowed me to develop a very personal connection with my work, without fixed rules, just letting myself be carried away by what I see and feel at all times.	What impact does commercialization have on your art and how sustainable do you think it is?	The commercialization of photography has a double impact on my work. On the one hand, it motivates me to constantly improve my technique and explore new forms of expression so that my images are valued not only on a personal level but also in a broader market. On the other hand, it can be challenging, as the balance between creativity and commercial demand sometimes limits artistic freedom.	Currently, for me, photography is a passion rather than a means of livelihood, so its sustainability depends on how much I can integrate this passion into economically viable projects. I believe that, with the right strategy, it is possible to find a middle ground where art and marketing coexist without compromising the authenticity of the work.	Versión en español	¿Qué te inspiró a crear tu arte?	Desde niña siempre he sentido un amor enorme por mi cultura y las tradiciones de mi tierra, Sicuani, en Cusco. Creo que hay algo muy especial en poder capturar esos momentos, colores y paisajes que forman parte de nuestra identidad. La fotografía se convirtió en mi manera de compartir esa belleza con el mundo, de guardar y transmitir la esencia de lo que somos. Para mí, cada foto es una forma de honrar y preservar todo eso que nos hace únicos.	¿Quién te enseñó tu arte y qué significa esta relación para ti?	La verdad es que he aprendido fotografía de manera autodidacta. Comence tomando forografias con mi celular, y poco a poco he ido consiguiendo mejores equipos fotograficos, he ido explorando, probando y equivocándome hasta encontrar mi propio estilo. Cada foto que tomo es una oportunidad para mejorar y entender mejor lo que quiero transmitir. Para mí, esta forma de aprender ha sido muy especial porque me ha permitido desarrollar una conexión muy personal con mi trabajo, sin reglas fijas, solo dejándome llevar por lo que veo y siento en cada momento.	¿Cuál es el impacto que tiene la comercialización en tu arte y qué tan sostenible crees que es?	La comercialización de la fotografía tiene un impacto doble en mi trabajo. Por un lado, me motiva a mejorar constantemente mi técnica y a explorar nuevas formas de expresión para que mis imágenes sean valoradas no solo a nivel personal, sino también en un mercado más amplio. Por otro lado, puede representar un reto, ya que el equilibrio entre la creatividad y la demanda comercial a veces limita la libertad artística.	Actualmente, para mí, la fotografía es una pasión más que un medio de sustento, por lo que su sostenibilidad depende de cuánto pueda integrar esta pasión en proyectos viables económicamente. Creo que, con la estrategia adecuada, es posible encontrar un punto medio donde el arte y la comercialización coexistan sin comprometer la autenticidad de la obra.	Interview with Visual Artist (Empower Andean Arts campaign)- Davis Torres Garcia	My name is Davis. I am from Cusco, I am Cusqueño. I am a visual artist. Well, I do different types of art, such as murals, oil paintings, watercolours, and stylographs.	What inspired you to create your art?	“Many things, I think, many things. I am searching for different things—information, culture, the process of city evolution, exploitation, etc. Many things.	At the moment, I feel like I’m on a path where I haven’t yet found my way. So there are many sources of inspiration—nature, people, mysticism, elements from Peru, and many other things.”	At what age did you start creating art?	“Honestly, I haven’t been doing art for long. At first, I don’t know if it’s good to say this, but I used to hate art. When I was a child, I couldn’t stand it. But when I was around 23, I started to feel much more curious.	So I am still in a stage of evolution, understanding, and figuring out how art helps me personally and what it expresses.”	Who taught you your art, and what does that relationship mean to you?	“I think it was a natural process. No one taught me; it just happened naturally—I picked up a pencil and, out of curiosity, wanted to draw something. And I realized that I could.	So, that’s how it happened.”	Are there specific symbols, patterns, or techniques in your art that are important to Andean history or spirituality?	“Yes, there are a lot of symbols. I’ve been researching many symbols. I don’t work much with the Andes, but that was my starting point. I work more with the jungle. My work is a mix of everything, honestly, because everything is connected.”	What is the importance of education in preserving art?	“Traditions. I believe traditions are very important, but it depends on the communities. In Peru, we have many communities that are slowly disappearing due to globalization, economic influences, etc. So, I think traditions are very important because each community has its way of learning and teaching.”	Do you have a favourite tradition?	“No, they are all very interesting. For example, textiles—how people connect with plants and designs. These teachings have been passed down for generations, even before writing existed.”	Have these traditions influenced your work?	“Yes, in one way or another. But what I haven’t done is copy them directly. I believe we must respect these traditions because they are not originally mine.	I might know a little about them, but not deeply. I can be influenced by them or feel inspired, but I don’t appropriate them.”	What challenges do you face in keeping traditional techniques alive in the modern world?	“I don’t see myself as someone who is preserving traditions in a strict sense. The only thing I do is research and document what I think exists.	Some things exist, and I simply portray them. So, preserving them happens through my art, and I believe it can also influence young people.”	Do you think young people today are losing interest in art?	“No. Young people are very curious—about all kinds of art. It’s not just painting.	There’s theatre, film, and many different forms of art that young people explore. So, I believe that’s the way forward. For me, education should first focus on art, then philosophy, and so on.”	Have you taught your art to anyone else?	“Yes, but very little. I’m not very used to teaching. But yes, I have shown my work, and sometimes I’ve connected very well with people.	I am against the idea that some people think they “can’t do art.” So I try to develop techniques that help people connect with painting and overcome fear.”	What have you learned about Andean culture, history, and identity through your artistic journey?	“That it’s not all just about the Incas. There’s much more.	Today, there are so many communities in the mountains that I don’t even really know about. Historically, we read about them in books, but to truly understand, you need to study, read a lot, and, most importantly, live among those communities.	For example, I could read many books about the Q’ero people, but if I haven’t been there, I can’t truly say I know them.”	Do you think traditional Andean art is at risk of losing its authenticity as it becomes more commercialized?	“I believe that in cities, yes. In cities, I think it is being lost because, as I mentioned before, money drives everything.	In remote communities, I think the sharing tradition still exists. People work for each other, share, and trade. But in cities, the ones selling traditional art for commercial purposes are often not even Andean. They could be, or they could be a mix. What’s the term for that? The mix between an Andean and an urban person—mestizo.	So, yes, there are people who see it just as a business because of tourism. That’s the reality.”	What impact does commercialization have on your art, and how sustainable do you think it is?	“Well, that’s a question I always ask myself: how can I survive with art?	Sometimes I can… but it’s not very sustainable for me. That’s why I have another job.	I work elsewhere, and that also inspires me. I don’t dedicate myself to art 100% of the time. I don’t know how to make a living from art, but I love painting.	It’s a way for me to see something and bring it to life. That’s it. But yes, I try to sell my work. Sometimes there are buyers, sometimes not.”	What do you think is the trajectory of your art? What do you hope for?	“I believe that as artists, and as people, we all need to leave something on this planet. We need to do something.	I don’t know exactly what. But I think my art can have an impact—on young people, on society, etc.	That’s what I seek with my paintings, but I still haven’t found the right path.	I’m searching.”	Versión en español	Mi nombre es Davis. Soy de Cusco. Soy un artista plástico. Trabajo con diferentes tipos de técnicas, por ejemplo: murales, hago óleo, acuarela, estilógrafos.	¿Qué te inspiró a crear tu rate?	“Muchas cosas. Aun estoy en busca de diferentes aprendizajes , de información cultura, el proceso de la evolución de las ciudades, también de exploración de las diferentes regiones, su biodiversidad, las historias mitológicas que obviamos,  el misticismo, la diversidad que tenemos en Perú y en el mundo etc.	Hay diferentes maneras de inspirarme y ando buscando cual es mi camino con el rate.”	¿Y desde qué edad has creado tu rate?	“La verdad, no hace mucho. Primero, no sé si es bueno decirlo, pero yo odiaba el arte. Cuando era niño no podía estar con el arte. Cuando tuve  23 años, recién tuve mucha más curiosidad.	Pienso que  estoy en una etapa de evolución, de entendimiento, de como me ayuda personalmente y de expresión.”	¿Y qui	é	n te enseñó tu arte y qu	é	significa esta relación para ti?	“Yo creo que fue la naturaleza quien me enseño. Un día agarre el lápiz y me di cuenta que podia plasmar lo que veía y  crear algo. Fue algo natural que lo traía. Pienso que tengo una relación profunda con el arte, como algo espiritual, algo que nunca podría dejarlo aunque quisiera.”	¿	Y hay sí	mbolos, patrones o t	é	cnicas espec	í	ficas en tu arte que sean importantes para la historia o espiritualidad andina?	“Si existen, pero trato de que no sea lo comercial. Realmente no trabajo mucho con los Andes, pero sí ha sido mi inicio. Trabajo más con la selva y trato de no encasillarme  en un solo tema. Mi trabajo es una mezcla de todo, sinceramente, porque todo está conectado.”	¿Y para ti cuál es la importancia de la educación para preservar el rate?	“Las tradiciones. Creo que las tradiciones son muy importantes. En  Perú tenemos diversidad cultural  que se están perdiendo lentamente  por las diferentes aspectos sociales, la globalización, influencias económicas, etc.Nos hacen entender nuestra identidad a pesar de que soy mestizo.  Entonces, creo que las tradiciones son muy importantes ya que las etnias de diferentes localidades han  tenido  y tienen  una forma de aprender y enseñar desde generaciones anteriores.”	¿Y tienes una tradición favourite?	“No, todos son muy interesantes. Toda  estas enseñanzas culturas vienen de siglos  pasados, antes de la escritura incluso.”	¿Y han influido a tus obras?	“Sí, de alguna u otra forma, sí. Pero lo que sí no he hecho es copiar las cosas de ellos. Creo que tenemos que tener un respeto a las practicas tradicionales de cada cultura.Puede que sepa un poco sobre ellos, pero no profundamente como me gustaría. Puedo dejarme influenciar por ellos o sentirme inspirado, pero no apropiarme de su rate.”	¿Y cuáles son los desafíos que enfrentas para mantener viva las técnicas tradicionales en el mundo modern?	“Creo Yo por el medio de arte, mediante sus técnicas tradicionales, como por ejemplo los textiles, sus ropas, en los artefactos personales, etc  enseñar y  mostrar a los jovenes que es importante e inspirarles por medio de mi arte y el arte traditional.”	¿Y no crees que haya una desafección por las artes en los jóvenes en el momento o no?	“No.	Los jóvenes son muy curiosos en cualquier tipo de arte. No solo es la pintura,	teatro, cine, etc, en  todo tipos de arte van a tener curiosidad los jovenes, creo que por ahí es.El arte siempre va estar al servicio de los jovenes y del mundo.	Tal vez se ve a los jovenes actuales perdiendo el interés por el artes, es el efecto de las pantallas “vivas” y la falta de difundir lo que realmente significa el arte, ya que podría generar sensibilidad para el muno.”	¿Y has enseñado a otra persona tu arte o no?	“Sí, sí, pero muy poco. No estoy acostumbrado a  mostrar mi arte. Algunas veces he conectado muy bien con las personas gracias a mi trabajo.	Estoy en contra de la idea de que algunas personas piensen que “no pueden hacer arte”. Por eso trato de desarrollar técnicas que ayuden a las personas a conectarse con la pintura y superar el miedo.”	¿Y qué aprendiste sobre la cultura, la historia y la identidad andinas al desarrollar tu rate?	“De que tenemos una diversidad cultural que no solo se basa en la historia de los Incas .	Actualmente hay tantos grupos etnicos en las diferentes regiones del Perú, que se ignoran por que vivimos en la ciudades.	He aprendido a respetar la tierra, respetar a nuestra humanidad, a entender nuestra realidad y nuestros antepasados.	Históricamente, leemos sobre ellos en libros, pero para comprenderlos verdaderamente es necesario estudiar, leer mucho y, lo más importante, vivir entre esas comunidades.	Por ejemplo, podría leer muchos libros sobre el pueblo Q’ero, pero si no he convivido con ellos, no puedo decir realmente que los conozco.”	¿Y crees que el arte andino tradicional est	á	en riesgo de perder su autenticidad a medida que se comercializa m	á	s?	“Yo creo que si.	La comercialización de  objetos tradicionales se están y se han convertido en una forma de  ingreso monetario, olvidándose realmente su significado y utilización cultural.	La verdad es que es un tema difícil, ya que son varios factores: La necesidad, el turismo, la fata de oportunidades en la ciudades, etc.	En las comunidades remotas,  la tradición de compartir todavía existe. Las personas trabajan unas para otras, comparten y comercian.	Pero en las ciudades, quienes venden arte tradicional con fines comerciales muchas veces ni siquiera son andinos. Entonces sí, hay gente que lo ve sólo como un negocio por el turismo.”	¿	Cuá	l es el impacto que tiene la comercialización en tu arte y qu	é	tan sostenible crees que es?	“Bueno, esta es una pregunta que siempre me hago. ¿Cómo es que puedo sobrevivir con el arte?  Sí, a veces puedo… no es tan sostenible para mí, Por eso tengo otro trabajo eso me inspira también. A veces no me dedico al 100%. Pero de alguna forma me dedico a ello y amo pintar.	Me es difícil de vender ya que soy malo haciendo negocios.	Creo que mi arte crea un impacto en las personas, aveces de conciencia o algo personal y se lo llevan.	Es una manera de ver algo y darle vida. Eso es todo. Pero sí, intento vender mi trabajo. A veces hay compradores y otras no.”	¿	Qu	é	crees que es la trayectoria de tu arte? ¿	Qu	é	esperas?	“Creo que como artistas , como personas, todos debemos  dejar algo en el planeta. Necesitamos hacer algo, dejar una huella.	No sé exactamente qué. Pero creo que mi arte puede tener un impacto: en los jóvenes, en la sociedad, etc.	Eso es lo que busco con mis pinturas, pero todavía no encuentro el camino correcto.	Estoy en busca de mi camino.	Gracias.”	As a part of our Empower Andean arts campaign, we have chosen to interview a few local artists in Cusco to understand what Andean art means to them.	Today, we have met up with Joan, a music artist here in Cusco.	Can you please introduce yourself and the art?	“My name is Joan. I’m from Cusco, and my art is music in general and writing and researching.”	And what type of music is it?	“Well, now I’m doing more Andean music, and researching and learning more about it.”	What inspired you to learn about Andean music?	“Well, really, I didn’t know a lot about Andean music before, because I was in another kind of music, more like rock, electronic music.	And then, during the pandemic, I was in Urubamba, in the Sacred Valley, and I started to go in with a group of panflutes, named Sikuris. So from then, I think I started to be more interested in Andean music.	I grew up always with this kind of music, but I never understood it.  But now, recently, I’m trying to discover new things that I didn’t know about music in general.”	And what is the type of instrument that you play?	“I play more strings, like guitar, charango, and mandolina.  And then I play some winds, panflutes,and quena (Andean wind instrument). And before this, I play electronic music too computer too.”	Oh, wow, that’s very interesting.	“But now I’m doing more acoustic, like with the strings and winds.	And with those acoustic instruments, are they traditional Peruvian instruments?	The strings are not, they are brought from Spain.	But the Andean culture, they, how do you say this? They accept them, and they put it in the music, Andean music too.	But the winds like the panflutes, of course, they are native from here.”	What challenges do you think you face in keeping those traditional instruments and traditional folklore music alive in a world that is rapidly modernizing?	“So the Andean music is really big, but we can divide it in two. One is like the more commercial music. And the other one is native or the more original music.	So the difference is really clear because in commercial music, this kind of music has more like melody, harmony or mystic sounds. That there is nothing wrong with	And the other kind of music, the native, more deep in the Andes, is not always melodic. It’s very high sometimes, and it’s different. Some people would say it is dissonant.	It was a challenge for me to figure out how to enjoy this music at first because it’s so different. But right now we are researching a lot of things that we didn’t previously know a lot about. But communities have always been exposed to this type of music, and some are heirs to this musical tradition.	The challenge would be to learn how to listen more to this music and enjoy it, or as some say decolonize your ear.”	Did those traditional folklore music teach you anything that you didn’t know about the Andean culture, history, or identity?	“Yeah, of course. The heart of the Andean music is the panflutes. But we call it Sikuri, it’s the name in Puquina. Puquina is an ancient name before Quechua and other languages. So I think everything about Andean music is in the panflutes.	The planflutes taught me what it really means to play Andean music. So the world of the panflutes, there are hundreds of styles, it’s a whole universe, the panflutes. When you play panflutes, you don’t have to play it alone, you have to play it with someone.”	Oh, okay. So it’s like a community music.	“Yeah, like all the Andean world it’s very important to play it in the community, and not to be alone. So the goal of this kind of music, of the panflutes, is not only to make beautiful music, It’s also  the social integration. Even when you go to the communities, you can see little children playing it.	When you play panflutes, there is one that has to ask, and the other one has to do the answer. So it’s a conversation. Of two first, and then can be four, and then can be six, twenty. You know, it’s like how the universe works with cooperation. We call it in Quechua, we say Yanantin.”	And in that music, does it normally tell a story? Or does the music itself mean anything?	“Yes, there are like 100 or more styles, depending on the community.	So each community plays a different style.  For example, here in Cusco, close to Cusco, in Chumbivilcas	,	we have one group, we call Ayarachis	.	For example, they play it in rituals for the dead.	In other parts of Peru and South America, they play it for other intentions too like agriculture.	For example, in Puno, in Taquile, one island, they play it in a special time for seasonal change and fertility.  And after they play it, they break the panflutes. They destroy them.  It’s like some sort of connection with the moon, with the sun, and the field, and the territory, and the person, and the changes. So it was more for this kind of sacred ritual.”	In terms of commercialization, do you think that music is at risk of losing its identity?	“Not really, I don’t think so. I think there is an essence that we are not losing. For example, these things, playing together, playing in community, playing in cooperation, and other things about more musical things.  So would you say that commercialization has no effect?  Yeah, it has.	I say that the Andean music is changing but we are not losing the core. But of course, modernization sometimes can take off this essence and make it like a product. In any case, it is adapting to modernization, the question is not to lose that Andean logic.”	Versión en español	¿Podrías presentarte a ti mismo y a tu rate?	“Mi nombre es Joan. Soy de Cusco, y mi arte es la música en general y escribir a veces, investigando.”	¿Y qué tipo de música es?	“Bueno, ahora estoy haciendo más música andina, e investigando y aprendiendo más de ella.”	¿Qué te inspiró a aprender sobre la música andina?	“Bueno, en realidad, antes no sabía mucho sobre la música andina, porque yo estaba en otro género musical, más como rock, música electrónica.	Luego, durante la pandemia, estuve en Urubamba, en el Valle Sagrado, en donde empecé a  entrar con un grupo de músicos que tocan la zampoñas, llamado Sikuris. A partir de entonces, creo que empecé a interesarme más por la música andina.	Crecí siempre con este tipo de música, pero nunca la entendí.  Pero ahora, desde hace poco, intento descubrir cosas nuevas que no sabía sobre la música en general.”	¿Y qué tipo de instrumento tocas?	“Toco más cuerdas, como guitarra, charango y mandolina.  Y luego toco algunos instrumentos de viento, zampoñas y quena (instrumento de viento andino). Además, también toco música electrónica por ordenador.”	Vaya, eso es muy interesante.	“Pero ahora hago música más acústica, como con las cuerdas y los vientos.”	Y con esos instrumentos acústicos, ¿son instrumentos tradicionales peruanos?	“Las cuerdas no, son traídas de España. Pero la cultura andina los acepta y los hace parte de su música. Pero los vientos como las zampoñas, por supuesto, son nativos de aquí.”	¿A qué retos cree que se enfrenta para mantener vivos esos instrumentos tradicionales y la música folclórica tradicional en un mundo que se moderniza rápidamente?	“La música andina es muy grande, pero podemos dividirla en dos. Una es la música más comercial. Y la otra es la música nativa o más original. Así que la diferencia es muy clara porque en la música comercial, este tipo de música tiene más como melodía, armonía o sonidos místicos.Que no tiene nada de malo.	Y el otro tipo de música, la nativa, más profunda en los Andes, no es tan melódica. A veces es muy aguda, y es different. Para mí fue un reto descubrir cómo disfrutar de esta música al principio, porque es muy diferente. Pero ahora estamos investigando muchas cosas de las que antes no sabíamos. Llas comunidades siempre han estado expuestas a este tipo de música, y algunos son herederos de esta tradicion musical	El reto seria aprender a ecuchar mas esta musica  y disfrutar, o como dicen algunos descolonizar tu oido.”	¿Le enseñaron esas músicas folclóricas tradicionales algo que no supiera sobre la cultura, la historia o la identidad andinas?	“Sí, por supuesto. El corazón de la música andina para mi son las zampoñas. Pero nosotros lo llamamos Sikuri, es el nombre en Pukina. Pukina es un nombre antiguo anterior al quechua y a otras lenguas. Así que creo que todo sobre la música andina está en las zampoñas.	Las zampoñas me enseñaron lo que realmente significa tocar música andina. Es todo un universo. Cuando tocas las zampoñas, no tienes que hacerlo solo, tienes que hacerlo con alguien.”	Ah, vale. Así que es como una música comunitaria.	“Sí, como en todo el mundo andino es muy importante tocarla en comunidad, y no estar solo. Así que el objetivo de este tipo de música, de las zampoñas, no es solo hacer música hermosa, es tambien la integración social. Incluso cuando vas a las comunidades, puedes ver a niños pequeños tocándola.	Cuando tocas la flauta de pan, uno tiene que preguntar y el otro tiene que responder. Así que es como una conversación. De dos primero, y luego pueden ser cuatro, y luego pueden ser seis, veinte. Es como funciona el universo con la cooperación. En quechua, decimos Yanantin.”	Y en esa música, ¿normalmente cuenta una historia? ¿O la música en sí significa algo?	“Sí, hay como 100 estilos o más, dependiendo de la Comunidad. Entonces cada comunidad toca un estilo diferente.  Por ejemplo, cerca de Cusco, en Chumbivilcas, tenemos un grupo, que se llaman Ayarachis.	Por ejemplo, lo tocan en rituales para los muertos. En otras partes de Perú y Sudamérica, lo tocan también para otras intenciones como la agricultura.	Por ejemplo, en Puno, en Taquile, una isla, lo tocan en un tiempo especial para el cambio estacional y la fertilidad.  Y después de tocarlo, destruyen los instrumentos. Es como una especie de conexión con la luna, con el sol, y el campo, y el territorio, y la persona, y los cambios. Así que era más para este tipo de ritual sagrado.”	En términos de comercialización, ¿cree que la música corre el riesgo de perder su identidad?	“La verdad es que no, no lo creo. Creo que hay una esencia que no estamos perdiendo. Por ejemplo, estas cosas, tocar juntos, tocar en comunidad y tocar en cooperación.  Entonces, ¿diría que la comercialización no tiene ningún efecto?  Sí, lo tiene.	Yo digo que la música andina está cambiando pero no estamos perdiendo el núcleo. Pero claro, la modernización a veces puede quitar esa esencia y convertirla en un producto. En todo caso se esta adaptando a la modernizacion, la cuestion es no perder esa logica andina.”	15 Years of LAFF – Reflections from a Current Volunteer	When I joined Latin American Foundation for the Future as a volunteer, I didn’t know that a key part of my role as Communications Coordinator would be celebrating LAFF’s 15th anniversary through social media and a fundraising campaign. This experience has proven to be a unique opportunity to get to know the organisation from its beginning until now. Sifting through beneficiary stories, volunteer testimonials, and statistics, I have been able to learn about and understand LAFF’s impact over the years while searching for content and memories for the 15	th	anniversary celebration – a perspective I might not have gained otherwise.	As I delved into the archive, I discovered just how much LAFF has grown. Its journey cannot only be measured in terms of impact and scale but equally in its commitment to its core values. Established in 2007 by its founder, Sarah Oakes, LAFF initially extended its support to one local partner organisation – Azul Wasi, a home for vulnerable boys. Sarah’s inspiration led to the creation of an NGO devoted to facilitating access to quality education, personal development, and better opportunities for children and young people in Cusco and the Sacred Valley. Over the course of the subsequent years, LAFF’s family expanded, partnering with three new local organisations – Mantay, Mosqoy, and the Sacred Valley Project.	It’s difficult to say how many volunteers have shared part of LAFF’s journey, but each has left their mark in a different way by giving their varying amounts of time and diverse skills. While some come and go, there are those who have stayed connected to LAFF. Only a few weeks ago we were visited by a former volunteer from 2016 who was delighted to catch up on our progress, and we also have trustees who were once volunteers and still continue to support LAFF in a different way. The genuine, continued commitment of those who’ve been part of LAFF’s programmes is an attestation to the authenticity of our values and goals, and it’s heartwarming to see how many are eager to stay engaged and connected. Many volunteers will remember their time at LAFF as a very special moment in their lives. I know I will look back on my time with the team at LAFF very fondly, as a time of friendship and personal growth. I have learned so much not only in the realms of professional experience but also regarding the people, culture, and history of Cusco.	Me with the team after everyone tried cuy, fried guinea pig (except me!).	Of course, LAFF’s impact can’t fully be appreciated without considering the experiences of the beneficiaries it supports. LAFF has now reached an age that allows beneficiaries to have received support throughout their entire educational experience. For example, there are young adults who first stayed at a Sacred Valley Project dorm for the duration of their secondary schooling, before continuing to the Mosqoy house to facilitate further education at an institution in Cusco. The ability to see long-term impact serves as a reminder of LAFF’s purpose and demonstrates why LAFF focuses on improving access to and quality of education.	In c
