MISSION & IMPACT	The Sacred Valley Project Mission	The mission of the Sacred Valley Project (SVP) is to provide boarding and supplementary education for young women from remote Andean communities so that they can continue and complete their secondary education.	SVP facilitates secondary school access for indigenous girls from remote communities. SVP currently operates three dormitories, enabling 54 girls to attend secondary school. The dormitories remove the barrier of a long, unsafe and often impossible journey to secondary school. While living at the dormitory, girls receive comprehensive support and full-time supervision. SVP provides daily balanced meals, supplemental academic support through small-group tutoring, extracurricular activities, and mental and physical health care. SVP’s culturally sensitive approach is guided by community engagement in the project. Many SVP graduates have the goal of returning home after their studies to support their families and communities.	SVP envisions a world in which every girl has access to a quality education and the opportunity to reach her full potential. SVP aims to achieve this vision by supporting rural, indigenous Peruvian girls in their educational goals.	View Our 2024 Annual Report Here	Why Girls?	Girls’ education strengthens economies and creates jobs. Millions of educated girls, means more working women with the potential to add up to $12 trillion USD to global growth.  -Malala Fund	Educated women invest 90% of their earnings back into their families.  -Clinton Global Initiative	420 million people would be lifted out of poverty by achieving a secondary education. This would cut the number of people living in poverty by more than half.  -UNESCO	Communities are more stable — and can recover faster after conflict — when girls are educated. When a country gives all its children secondary education, they cut their risk of war in half. Education is vital for security around the world because extremism grows alongside inequality.   -Malala Fund	Educated girls are healthier citizens who raise healthier families. The World Bank reports that universal secondary education for girls could virtually eliminate child marriage. Each year of secondary education reduces the likelihood of marrying as a child by five percentage points or more.  -The World Bank	Investing in girls’ education is good for our planet. Secondary schooling for girls the most cost-effective and best investment against climate change. Research also suggests that girls’ education reduces a country’s vulnerability to natural disasters.  -The Brookings Institute	Support Girls' Education	Why We Do This Work	In the Sacred Valley of Peru, the world’s most direct descendants of the Inca Empire live in extreme poverty, struggling to meet even the most basic of needs. One of the most severe problems for rural villages in the region is a lack of access to public services. Children must walk several hours to the nearest elementary school and high schools are often only located in larger towns, too far from home for students to commute daily. While boys often move to urban centers to pursue an education, this same opportunity is not available for many girls. In 2010, SVP was founded in order to address the need for better access to secondary schools for adolescent girls. During our first year of operation, we served 6 students. Today, SVP serves more than 50 girls from over 20 different Andean communities in the Sacred Valley of Peru.	How We Accomplish our Mission	The Sacred Valley Project addresses the need for better access to secondary school for Quechua girls from rural Andean communities  by removing the barrier of a long and unsafe journey, providing a dormitory and education center where the girls can live in a safe and nurturing environment all while receiving nutritious meals,  after school tutoring, mentorship and post-secondary guidance.	Academics	From inception, the dormitory was intended to be more than just a living space. It is a place of community and growth, in which the girls learn to set goals and achieve them in a warm and positive environment. We provide a space that nurtures and supports indigenous girls in their endeavor to adapt to the culture of an urban area, Spanish speaking schools, and academic struggles as result of poor primary education.  Each year, SVP beneficiaries receive over 2000 hours of professional tutoring and academic support from local, Quechua speaking tutors. As a result of this support, 100% of SVP students are currently graduating from the program.	Support our Tutoring Program	Let’s Work Together	Contact Us

By far the best part of my experience was volunteering at the Sacred Valley Project’s dormitory and working with the six incredibly intelligent and unique girls who live there.	My primary responsibility at the dorm was helping the students with their homework. I really enjoyed this activity because I was able to work with the girls one on one and get to know them. I was glad that by offering them homework help, I was able to give them something in return for generously welcoming me into their home.	I feel so fortunate to have been welcomed into the dorm, and I would highly recommend volunteering with the Sacred Valley Project to everyone. I wish that I could have volunteered for much longer in order to continue building relationships and trust with the students, and I hope to return soon. I will never forget the dance party that the girls, Bianca, and I had the last night I was at the dorm. The girls taught me how to dance to huaynos, and we laughed so hard we fell on the floor multiple times. I am so glad to have experienced Yanet’s shy smile, Jessica’s hard working nature, Katy’s friendliness, Nohemi’s bubbly nature, Maria Elena’s uniqueness, and Dina’s incredible maturity and kindness.	-Gaby Sloss, Tufts University, Class of 2011	Become an intern	Intern with us!

START A CHARTERED CLUB	The Sacred Valley Project hopes to make the dormitory financially sustainable and improve international awareness through the spread of local chapters in schools, universities, churches and community centers across North America.	Chartered clubs can work to spread awareness about women’s rights, girls’ education, indigenous education and poverty while raising money to support the education of young women in the Peruvian highlands.	We plan to work closely with such clubs and to provide all the necessary support to make the charter a success. This includes help with event planning, alpaca handicrafts to sell, literature about the project, networking and all the necessary documentation to make the club official.	To achieve this goal we need your help. Found a charter! If you are interested in starting a club at your school or in your community,	please contact us!	Other Ways to Get Involved!
