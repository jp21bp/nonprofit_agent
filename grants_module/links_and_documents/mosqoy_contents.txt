Our Vision & Mission
Our Vision	& Mission	Mosqoy works towards global sustainability and resilience by empowering local culture. We work with the Quechua population in the Andean mountains of Peru, a place that has been devastated by unsustainable tourism and development but that is home to amazing local leaders who are revitalizing their art and culture while maintaining a healthy, holistic, and spiritual connection with the land. We believe in empowering local communities through international solidarity and networking, sharing stories of celebration, struggle, and strength.	WE OPERATE	2	SOCIAL ENTERPRISES &	1	CHARITABLE PROGRAM	:	​	1.	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles	is our social enterprise that	works with Quechua weavers to keep their art and culture alive through the revitalization of authentic hand-woven textiles that use natural fibres and dyes. This textile tradition is a cultural cornerstone but at risk of disappearance due to synthetic machine-made replicas in the globalized marketplace.	This social enterprise offers local and global fair-trade market outlets, capacity-building initiatives, and community-led socioeconomic development projects. We have supported over 200 weavers in 11 communities.	2.	Mosqoy Field School	is our social enterprise that offers culturally responsible tours and field courses in Peru. In addition, we offer culturally and environmentally responsible tours to the general public, working with our partnering weaving communities and youth program graduates.	We work with youth from Canada and other countries in the Global North to educate about how to be more responsible travellers and consumers, both in their home countries and around the world. This program provides opportunities for youth to connect with and learn about issues facing communities in other parts of the world so that they can begin to change their habits of consumption and interaction.	Through this program, we have worked with over 6000 youth in the Global North.	​	3.	The profits from both of these social enterprises funds the	Mosqoy Youth Program	, which supports promising yet marginalized youth from remote communities in the region by providing post-secondary educational scholarships. This allows students to return to their communities with the skills and qualifications needed to compete in their communities’ new job sectors and act as community leaders for the next generation.	As part of this program, we operate	Casa Mosqoy	, a student dormitory in Cusco, where scholarship students live communally during their studies. Here they receive mentorship, personal counselling, and supplementary education that focuses on professional and personal development, leadership skills, and cultural empowerment. We have supported over 70 students in the region thus far to graduate with post-secondary diplomas.	​	Through our Ambassadorship, this program also brings its top graduates to the University of Victoria to study English and act as cultural ambassadors. We have hosted five Quechua ambassadors in Victoria thus far.
==============================
Our Values
Our Values	Our values run the show here at Mosqoy. No matter how challenging our non-profit work becomes, we do not believe in compromising these values under any circumstances. We continuously work towards improving our core values, so that our actions align with our words.
==============================
Our Model
Our Model	It’s not just another scholarship program. It’s not just another fair-trade textile store. It’s not just another travel agency. It’s all of those in one.	With complex problems must come complex interdisciplinary solutions. Therefore, we have created a multi-pronged organization that combines two social enterprises and one charitable program to collectively tackle our goal.	Through our model, all generations (youth to elders), rights-holders (community members and artists) and many stakeholders (business owners, tourists, and consumers) are actively involved in flipping the cycle of systemic oppression. Through Mosqoy, culture and economy support each other, rather than fight against one another.	The Issue:	​	Mosqoy began after Ashli Akins witnessed a false dichotomy that was continuously playing out in the communities of the Sacred Valley of Peru: a clash between cultural revitalization and economic development.	While indigenous Quechua women and elders try to keep their culture alive in the face of a globalized capitalist marketplace, youth of the region try to grasp onto new job sectors that are seemingly at their fingertips, though slightly out of reach.	Both competition with machine-made synthetic knock-offs and discrimination against the Indigenous Quechua culture have led to a decline of the textile tradition, a culturally rich knowledge system that has provided empowerment and voice to Indigenous	campesino	women for generations. Because the textile tradition is passed down orally, elders fear that – within this one generation – if youth do not learn the art, it will disappear.	On the other side of this dichotomy, new job opportunities are seemingly at the fingertips of the youth of these communities, as hotels, roads, and restaurants pop up. But because this is the first generation to work in these new job sectors, their teachers and parents cannot train them in the skills they need to be employable, and most youth do not have the funding to receive formal training. Thus, local youth are left unemployed, as outsiders from the cities easily outcompete for local jobs.	Millions of dollars enter this region, representing a huge economic growth and a prospering “middle-income” country. But the money does not go into the hands of local families, and is not distributed so that those who face the consequences of development reap the benefits.	Binary representing perceived lack of options faced by Quechua weavers, by Ashli Akins, 2013,	In Defense of the Artist	, master’s thesis, University of Oxford.	These two vicious cycles – of cultural loss and poverty – are the invisible stories underlying all of the beauty. Many community members – youth, elders, and families – of the region feel as though they must choose between keeping their culture alive and developing economically.	Our Working Model:	​	We have created a multi-pronged system to combat this challenge, uniting elders and youth in the fight against cultural loss and systemic poverty. Our	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles	supports Indigenous weavers who practice their textile tradition to keep their culture alive while economically stabilizing their families and communities. Our	Mosqoy Field School	works to shift the effects of tourism and development from negative to positive, by educating consumers and travellers about how to be more responsible guests when visiting sacred Indigenous lands, both here in Peru and all over the world. Profits from these social enterprises support our charitable program, the	Mosqoy Youth Program	, which supports the most promising youth from these communities to find employment in their regions’ new job sectors, by providing post-secondary educational scholarships.	​	Much of this writing was inspired by, directly quoted, or paraphrased from the work of Ashli Akins, specifically her master’s thesis, “In Defense of the Artist” (2013) and her TedX talk, “Cultural Shrapnel: Unfulfilled promises of a traveler” (2014).
==============================
Our History
Our History	Mosqoy started in 2006. Over a decade later, it is still growing, little by little, through remarkable volunteer hours and donations. We have supported over 70 youth to attend post-secondary educational institutes, and over 150 weavers through capacity-building workshops and fair-trade market outlets. We have spoken to thousands of youth across North America about responsible travel and consumption. Two of our alumni are now on our Peru Board of Directors.	2006	April	–	21-year-old Ashli Akins arrives in Ollantaytambo, Peru, for the first time, as part of a seven-month solo backpacking trip across Central and South America. While living with a local family, she volunteers at a local museum as an art teacher for disadvantaged youth and as a “llama” to carry traditional textiles to and from highland Quechua communities.	May –	Through her work with weavers in the Patakancha Valley, Ashli hears about the stories of cultural loss from elders in the region. Through her social scene, she hears her friends struggling to obtain jobs and continue their education.	June –	Weavers ask Ashli to assist them by finding	fair-trade	markets for their textiles. Ashli agrees to do what she can (what is now the	Q’ente Textile Program	), as long as all of the profits return to the communities to support their long-term socioeconomic goals. One of these goals proves to be education. Thus, in response to requests of several youth in the community of Ollantaytambo, as well as community leaders and elders, Ashli and her friend – local	Colegio Ollantay	graduate, Raul Cobos Mejia – start the	T’ikary Youth Program	(then called the Youth Bank for the Future).	July –	The first cohort of 20 T’ikary Youth Program scholarship students are selected from over 100 applications at the local high school,	Colegio Ollantay	.	July 22 –	Mosqoy hosts its	commencement event	(what is now celebrated as Mosqoy’s birthday!). Here, our scholarship students share beautiful speeches, weavers attend with their hand-woven products, and mothers hike down from their	campesino	communities to provide a delicious Andean feast. What seemed to be a small community project pivots into an international organization, and on this day, Ashli realizes that Mosqoy will become her life’s work. (Watch Ashli’s TedX Talk:	“Unfulfilled Promises: Cultural shrapnel of a traveler”	to learn more about this pivotal moment.)	September –	Ashli returns to Victoria, Canada, where she recruits volunteers and supporters, and creates a small but dedicated team of passionate Mosqoyites. Through her lectures and workshops in classes over the next few months, Ashli and other volunteers notice a shift in high-school and university students’ consciousness when hearing about the unperceived impacts of their daily decisions, and the invisible realities of development. Ashli decides to formalize these positive conversations, creating Mosqoy’s third and final program, what is now the	Mink’a Knowledge Exchange Program	.	2007	January –	Because of amazing volunteer support, fundraising, and partnerships, the first cohort of scholarship students move into their first rented	Casa Mosqoy	and enrol in their first semester of post-secondary education! Raul takes over as T’ikary Youth Program’s first volunteer resident advisor.	October –	Mosqoy: Sacred Valley Youth Fund	becomes an official Canadian registered charitable organization.	November –	We host our first annual Fall Environmental Studies Textile Fair, in collaboration with the University of Victoria’s School of Environmental Studies.	September –	Ashli receives the Vicky Husband Award for outstanding volunteer efforts in environmental protection, for her work with Mosqoy’s Q’ente Textile Program. Through this award, she and Vicky become close friends, and Vicky becomes a long-term supporter or “godmother” to Mosqoy.	2008	December –	Due to lack of financial support and student sponsors, we cannot enroll all of our selected sponsorship students this year, so we put four of the 15 on a waitlist. The other scholarship students do not want to start the semester without their peers, so they collectively rally to raise the remainder of the funds for their peers’ first semester of school, demonstrating true compassion, reciprocity, and leadership.	2009	June -	Because of increased presence of new	like-minded NGOs	that begin sprouting up in the region, combined with increased tourism traffic, we see that our support for fair-trade market outlets is better used in lesser served, more isolated communities. We respond to requests to work with remote weaving communities in the Mapacho River Valley.	August -	Through the friendship of	Frida Delgado Chirinos	and the efforts of new Board member Sarah Confer, we begin supporting capacity-building initiatives with start-up weaving cooperatives of Huaran and Cancha Cancha.	December -	Due to the efforts of English-language teacher Gerry Luton, our	Ambassadorship	is launched, and Rolando Auccapuri Iturriaga spends a semester at the University of Victoria in Canada as our first Ambassador.	2010	January –	As a practicum for her International Business Administration degree, T’ikary Youth Program scholarship student Elizabeth Jaimes Canal works as an intern for the Q’ente Textile Program for two semesters.	March –	Our textile program (Mosqoy’s first social enterprise) is officially registered as a B.C. not-for-profit society,	Q’ente Textile Revitalization Society.	Mosqoy also receives its first annual Canada Summer Jobs grant, allowing us to hire Canadian students as paid interns each summer.	May –	Due to circumstances beyond our	control, the T’ikary Youth Program is left	without a leader, so our students step up to keep the project alive. Four senior students (Elvira Huaman Guerra, Ebhert Alvarez Huaman, Rolando Auccapuri Iturriaga, and Adrian Jimenez Suma) voluntarily take over the leadership of the program to co-manage it while finishing their studies, and stay on as co-managers for one year after they graduate. Their leadership skills and reciprocity to the program inspire values that we continue to use in Casa Mosqoy to this day, and exemplify their growth from teenage high-school students to true community leaders.	June –	Our first cohort of students graduate from their professional degrees and the Mosqoy program! We hold a	community graduation ceremony	and invite only those who are directly impacted by the students’ education; 250 people attend.	October –	We win the Juror’s Choice Award at the World Art Market, in the textile category, for a	manta	that was produced in the highland community of Chahuaytire.	2011	January –	Thanks to a global video conference by Tim Kitchen, we establish a long-term connection with Ms. Laurie Renton’s grade three class of Battalion Park Elementary School, who fundraises for the	Q’enqo Library	and whose Peru curriculum comes alive through Mosqoy’s virtual lessons.	March –	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles launches its new	product lines	– a variety of high-quality textiles in the Traditional, Innovative, and Accessory Lines.	May –	The Q’ente Textile Program hosts its first	Encuentro	, a biennial gathering of weavers from all of our partnering communities, at	Casa Huaran	.	2012	March –	After over a year of hard work, we inaugurate the Q’enqo Library!	2013	March -	Our programs are growing fast, and the demand for them is too high to continue operating entirely as a volunteer team. We hire our first paid staff members, Kristina Zoller and Juan Clavijo.	2014	March –	We host our first	Mosqoy Field School	service-learning trip with high-school students from Brentwood College School. (Read about the experience	here	!)	December –	We host our	first gala	at the Fairmont Empress in Victoria, BC, with National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, Dr. Wade Davis, as our keynote speaker. With over 200 guests in attendance and a delicious four-course sustainable dinner, this gala pivots us into a new era of fundraising and introduces us to a new family of supporters.	December –	The Mink’a Knowledge Exchange Program creates a new department,	Research & Advocacy	, thanks to Alison Root’s advice, to elevate our impact globally.	2015	2016	July –	We celebrate 10 years of service and existence! We hold a community celebration	in Ollantaytambo, Peru, one block away from our commencement event 10 years prior, as well as a	celebratory gala	in Victoria, Canada, later this year.	August -	After 10 years of service,	Ashli resigns as Executive Director	and becomes Mosqoy’s Board president.	October –	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles launches its	online store	,	and begins shifting textile sales from ad-hoc fair booths to more financially sustainable	retail partnerships	in Peru and Canada.	September –	We launch our new brand, including our new logo, re-branded Quechua names for our programs, and a brand-new website, to begin our next decade of service!	2017	August -	Thanks to the financial support of SLASummit, Mosqoy partners with the Nueva Esperanza Weaving Association to purchase land in Parobamba! The land will be used for the construction of a communal traditional weaving centre, propagation natural-dye garden, and fair-trade retail outlet.	2018	August -	After over a year of visioning with both Boards of Directors, advisors, team members, community members, and program alumni, we launch a new era of Mosqoy! We shift to a simpler marketing strategy and a more financially viable model. In doing so, we legally dissolve the Q’ente Textile Revitalization Society and merge under one entity, Mosqoy, with two social enterprises: Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles and Mosqoy Field School, and one charitable program: the Mosqoy Youth Program.	July –	We move into our first real office in Cusco, Peru! We are part of the	Ayni Center	co-working space, which hosts like-minded organizations that are dedicated to socially and	environmentally conscious missions. We also launch Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles as a social enterprise, with a two-year pilot strategy, including hiring our first paid full-time Textiles Manager,	Cusi Saco Chung	. It is the beginning of a new era for our textile program, weavers, and fair-trade products! Alongside our status as an official Canadian Charitable Organization, we officially register as a Peruvian	Asociación Civil	,	under one unified name:	Mosqoy Peru	.	October –	Based on our new working model and multi-year restructuring process, we	launch our new	Three-Year Strategic Plan	! Mosqoy also participates in our first “DO DAY: The International Day of Doing,” where people all over the world host events and workshops to create change. This year's theme was the reduction and refusal of plastics. We were in charge of hosting	Do Day	in the region of Cusco, in collaboration with Casita Huaran! We focused on creating a sustainable tourism movement in the region.	September -	Our	Alpaca Recuperation Project	is launched in Cancha Cancha in collaboration with Ashli’s doctoral project at UBC to support alpaca-herders and spinners of the Illariy Ch’aska Women’s Cooperative in their effort to recuperate their traditional knowledge and diversity of natural alpaca colours amidst fast-fashion market pressures. It is the beginning of a 10-year-long project. Our Mosqoy graduate,	Rolando Auccapuri Iturriaga	, is now the owner and operator of local tour agency	Willka Travel	. With the income from his tour agency’s profits, he becomes a	Mosqoy Member	, donating monthly to the next generation of students! He is the first of our students to do so, beginning our dream of closing the circle with our very own graduates!	2019	April –	Mosqoy's founder, Ashli Akins, is honoured alongside Lieutenant General Roméo Dallaire and author Ursula K. Le Guin as	Humanist of the Year	at the University of Victoria's inaugural Humanitas Awards.	July –	We employ	Anshela Paravecino Kehuarucho	as our first full-time Quechua translator and cross-program community facilitator to invest in our values of community, accessibility, and inclusion.	August –	We are famous! We design our very own crepe for	La Boheme	’s menu, “La Mosqoy”, with proceeds from each sale going to our Youth Program. As a result of an amazing team effort headed by Cusi, we also launch our first	textile catalogue	for Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles, featuring all of our new products and designs, and gorgeous photo shoots in the high Andes.	September –	After a few years of putting our Mosqoy Youth Program on hold due to a lack of funding, as well as a need to restructure and adapt the program, we select our	8th cohort of scholarship students	- 8 students from 5 rural highland communities.	December –	Our former student, Nohemi Orihuela, from the highland community of Soccma, graduates from the Khipu Institute as a professional accountant, marking our	50th Mosqoy graduate!	January –	Thanks to a generous grant, we move into a brand-new (but still rented)	Casa Mosqoy	, which we use as our headquarters and student dormitory. It is a dream come true, with a garden, terrace, workshop spaces, and plenty of rooms for our students!	2020	May –	Mosqoy’s work is featured in	National Geographic	!	March –	COVID-19 hits, and everything is put on hold. Our students were en route to move into Casa Mosqoy (March 14) the day before we went into the world’s longest lockdown. We begin to go into crisis mode, adapt our programs, and find new ways to support our weavers and students, while trying to keep our small team employed. We begin working with food-basket campaigns, virtual-learning certificate programs, and virtual workshops.	September –	In collaboration with four other NGOs across Latin America, we launch the	Virtual Field School	, a certificate program that focuses on environmental change and sustainable communities across Latin America. 100% of the proceeds from the course go to the NGOs’ charitable programs during this challenging time of the pandemic.	December –	After a lot of DIY renovations, Casa Mosoqy opens its doors to the public for the first time, with a (small, COVID-safe) fair-trade, handmade	holiday fair	.	January –	One of our first Mosqoy graduates, who has been with us since our inception in 2006, comes full-circle! We hire	Elvira Huaman Guerra	as Casa Mosqoy’s new Resident Advisor, to be “mamá” of our students.	2021	March –	Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we launch our new and improved Mosqoy Youth Program curriculum, which includes a holistic complementary curriculum alongside university classes, consisting of English second-language classes, psychological and emotional support, Quechua language empowerment, certificate programs, tutoring support, and many other necessary and exciting additions.	April –	After waiting 1.5 years due to COVID-19, we begin recruiting our new cohort (our 9th!), opening up the Mosqoy Youth Program to more communities and youth in need across the region, and partnering with four local educational partners to do so.	Long-term team members who were instrumental in helping us accomplish these milestones include Brent Akins, Julia Anderson, Christina Burns, Cara Clatanoff, Denise Decloux, Bethany Foot, Reanna McMillan, Jasmine Nielsen, Beatriz Palacios Fernandez, Sonya Rokosh, and	many more	!
==============================
Our Regions
Where We Work	Mosqoy works in the Peruvian Andes, which make up the central region of the larger Andean mountain range, the longest north-south mountain range in the world. The land is characterized by deep, rolling hills and valleys nestled amongst breathtakingly high altitudes. These high plains, known as	puna	or	altiplano	, provided the ideal geographical structure to become the political and economic centre of Incan civilization.	​	The remnants of this magnificent civilization can still be seen by visiting the ceremonial site of Machu Picchu and many other Incan ruins throughout the region. Although Indigenous Quechua communities span the entire Andean mountain range, the Central Andes remains the heartland of Quechua peoples.	The Peruvian Andes are located in southeastern Peru, in the province of Cusco. One of the most striking aspects of the land is the vertical ecology, ranging from about 2800 to 4200 meters (9186 to 13,780 feet) above sea level. The climate is semi-arid, with two main seasons: the dry season and the rainy season.	​	Both seasons are characterized by chilly temperatures at night, yet there’s often ample sun during the day. The Andes are also home to humid, moisture-soaked cloud forests that sit high in the mountains. The plants and animals that live in these areas are unique, yet also largely undocumented, making the cloud forest a sensitive ecosystem.	​	Rural communities in Peru often consist of a number of farming families maintaining their	chakras	through subsistence agriculture and homesteading practices, so the majority of their food and livelihood is produced through working on the land.	Peruvian Landscape	Peruvian Landscape	1/1	In the high altitudes of the Peruvian Andes, agriculture is limited to a select few staple crops that manage to grow on the dry, steep hills. The potato is the most notable staple food, and it makes up the majority of the communities’ diet. Fortunately, due to thousands of years of knowledge-transfer, heritage strains have been passed down through generations, and over 200 varieties of potatoes are still grown and enjoyed.	​	Corn is another staple, bearing over 100 varieties of seeds. Other crops grown in smaller quantities include quinoa, kiwicha, wheat, and	habas	(large, broad beans). Cows, pigs, chickens and	cuy	(guinea pig) are often raised on Quechua homesteads, but eating meat remains a luxury rather than a daily staple.	​	Quechua, the Indigenous	language	of the Incas, is the main language spoken in the rural Andes, with Spanish as a distant second. While this has helped Quechua communities maintain their cultural traditions and identity, it often hinders them from participating in Peru’s economy, and therefore families are often very poor.	​	Quechua has no formal writing system, which makes its weaving	iconography	all the more important: symbols depicted in weavings convey knowledge of plants, animals, the local environment, and spiritual beliefs.
==============================
Our Languages
Language	The voice of the people	One of Mosqoy’s core values is cultural empowerment. We recognize the strong connection between preserving Indigenous languages and maintaining culture. Because of this, we strive to value and honour the Quechua language throughout the organization.	​	Although many people think that there is only one ‘Quechua’ language, perhaps with many different dialects, Quechua (or Quechuan) is actually a family of languages stretching throughout the Andean mountains in South America. There are dozens of Quechua languages within this family.	In Mosqoy’s partnering communities, Quechua is often spoken as a first language. All of the students in the Mosqoy Youth Program speak or understand some level of Quechua in addition to being fluent in Spanish. This is necessary for them because, in Peru, Spanish is the language of education, workplaces, and the government.	​	Until recently, many women in rural communities did not have the opportunity to attend school beyond their first few years, and so did not learn Spanish. Men, on the other hand, tend to understand a much higher level of Spanish, granting them more accessibility to the job market.	​	Almost all of the weavers we work with are women, so in order to ensure that our weavers understand all the nuances and complexities of our monthly community meetings for Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles, our policy is to always bring a Quechua-Spanish interpreter. Luckily, our Mosqoy Youth Program offers an excellent source of keen and eager interpreters, and we value the time, energy, and skill of our student interpreters by providing an honorarium for their services.	QUECHUA NAMES IN MOSQOY	As a symbol of our respect and value for the Quechua language, we have chosen Quechua names to represent various components of the organization and its textile products. All of these names were chosen with extensive input from our Mosqoy Youth Program students to represent important parts of the Quechua culture. By sharing these names with our supporters around the world, we are able to educate a little more about the Quechua language and culture.	​	Mosqoy:	dream, or to dream	. The name of the organization was chosen based on the entrance applications written by Mosqoy’s first cohort of students, in which every single student made a comment about the organization fulfilling a future dream of theirs.	​	As previously mentioned, Quechua is a family of languages that varies across countries and regions. Because of this, and because Quechua is traditionally an oral language, the spelling also varies, so different forms have emerged and continue to emerge, to best reflect the pronunciation. Therefore, there is not one correct way to spell Quechua words. "Mosqoy" for example, can also be spelled Musquy, Musqhuy, or Moscoy, among others.	When deciding on the spelling of Mosqoy, we consulted with many Quechua community leaders as well as two professionally trained Quechua teachers, all from the Cusco region of Peru. We also researched regional dialects and consulted dictionary usages. Through this process, we chose the spelling, “Mosqoy," to reflect the most common spelling of the word in the region we work.	​	​	Kallpa K’oj:	giving back energy	. This program brings together Mosqoy Youth Program students and Quechua weaving communities so that students can gain valuable insight into these rural communities, learn about their cultural heritage, and develop a greater sense of pride and belonging while providing volunteer help to benefit these communities. Kallpa K’oj is an important pillar of the Mosqoy Youth Program and is a way for the students to reciprocate the support they receive from Mosqoy.	In addition to these important Quechua names in the organization, our students have helped us choose Quechua names for every textile product we sell through the Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles social enterprise. We have included the translation and meaning of every Quechua name on each product's page on our	Etsy store	.	We have also offered Quechua translations of the product type to accompany the English and Spanish terms.	PRONOUNCING QUECHUA	​	While most letters in the writing system used for Quechua are familiar to English and Spanish speakers, you may notice that some of the Quechua words listed above, like	q’ente	, have apostrophes within the word. This is because Quechua has a complex system of consonants, with three different types of pronunciation for the consonants	p, t, k,	and	q	(the letter	q	sounds sort of like a	k,	but is produced a little further back in the mouth). Here are the three types of consonants:	Regular (p, t, k, q):	These consonants are the most similar to consonants in English and Spanish. For example, Mosqoy uses a regular	q	.	​	Aspirated (ph, th, kh, qh):	These letters are produced with a breath of air following them, sort of like the combination of a consonant and an	h.	In English, when letters like	p	and	t	start a word, they are aspirated like Quechua-aspirated consonants.	Ejective (p’, t’, k’, q’):	These are probably the hardest Quechua letters for English and Spanish speakers to pronounce, and give Quechua a very distinctive sound. They are produced with a complete closure of the glottis (vocal cords) followed by a dramatic burst of air. All three of our program names include ejective consonants: Q’ente, Mink’a, and T’ikary.	Qantu, the national flower of Peru	WEBSITE TRANSLATIONS	​	In the future, we plan to offer our website in four languages: English, French, Spanish, and Quechua. English and French are the two official languages of Canada, while Spanish and Quechua are two of the official languages of Peru, along with Aymara, one of Peru’s many other Indigenous languages, which is widely spoken in other regions of Peru.	While we recognize that most members of our partnering communities have limited access to technology and lack literacy in Quechua, offering our website in both written and recorded oral Quechua is an important embodiment of our values. Not only is it a symbolic gesture demonstrating the high level of value we give the Quechua language, but it also serves the educational purpose of showing our network outside of Peru what Quechua looks and sounds like.	It is particularly important to provide recordings to accompany the written website, as Quechua has traditionally always been an oral language, and only more recently written using the Latin script. Many people with strong reading and writing skills in Spanish only know Quechua as an oral language and are not able to read or write in Quechua. Once we launch this feature, we hope you will listen to the recordings while looking at the written Quechua to gain a better sense of this beautiful language.	​	Having our Mosqoy Youth Program students translate the website from Spanish into Quechua will allow them to practice their translation skills and use Quechua practically, which is an enormous employment advantage of being bilingual and fosters a continued connection to their mother tongue while studying away from their community and family in Cusco city. Their translation help will allow them to give back to the organization through the Kallpa K’oj service component of the Mosqoy Youth Program.	​	And who knows, in this increasingly technologically connected world, perhaps one day our partnering weavers may listen to their own biographies in Quechua on this website!

Mosqoy Youth Program	Supporting Quechua youth to pursue their dreams and lead their futures	Mosqoy's Youth Program — previously known as the T’ikary Youth Program — was launched in 2006 and funds the post-secondary education of promising students from rural communities of the Peruvian Andes.	​	This program empowers youth from rural highland Quechua communities to pursue their dreams of furthering their education while strengthening ties with their communities and their cultural heritage.	The Program's Objectives:	​	To provide educational opportunities for Quechua youth who cannot otherwise afford to continue their studies after high school	​	​	To equip more Indigenous youth leaders with the skills for forge a future for their communities that is economically and culturally resilient	​	​	To set in motion a cycle of reciprocity whereby scholarship students not only inspire the next generation of youth to dream towards brighter futures but actually go on to support them financially	Issues to Confront:	​	As of data collected in 2012, less than 5% of youth in highland Quechua communities of the Peruvian Andes carry on to study at technical institutes or universities.	​	From this ensues a rapidly deepening cycle of poverty and inequality:	​	A lack of education leads to a lesser capacity to participate in the changing economic context of globalization	​	​	With a lessening ability to benefit or have a say in Peru's surge of tourism and development, each generation becomes poorer than the last	​	​	Indigenous young women are especially disadvantaged as they are discriminated against with few educational and economic opportunities beyond their pre-determined gender roles that are often oppressive	​	The Project's Specifics	:	​	Mosqoy Youth Program assists post-secondary students every year by sponsoring their studies at tertiary institutions (universities and trade institutes) in Cusco. ​While enrolled, students live in Cusco at	Casa Mosqoy	, a dormitory-style residence, with a resident advisor. In exchange for this opportunity, students participate in fundraising events and volunteer service projects, to contribute to the education of future scholarship students. They are also encouraged to aid both their families and community through financial support, time, and/or skills, both during and after their studies.	​	​	Our goal is that the youth program will not only assist our current students but that it will become a self-sustaining system of education whereby the trend shifts towards an upward cycle of prosperity, resilience and autonomy.	Student Responsibilities:	​	While studying and living in Casa Mosqoy, the students are expected to:	​	Attend their classes and maintain high academic excellence	​	​	Contribute to the Mosqoy community and the Casa Mosqoy household by participating in events, meetings and student duties	​	​	Carry out volunteer service through our	Kallpa K’oj Program	, which allows students to use their skills to support Andean communities in Peru.	​	​	Give back to the youth program, their communities, and their families	Student Eligibility:	The selected students have demonstrated the following:	​	A strong desire to pursue their education after high school and obtain a professional career	​	A lack of economic resources to continue their studies	​	Willingness to assist their families, the youth program, and their communities	​	​	Good grades and leadership qualities	Where Does the Funding Come From?	​	Currently, the majority of our funding is provided by our generous donors and student sponsors. However, as we develop our social enterprises further, we plan to reduce the dependency on donors and fund the Mosqoy Youth Program through various revenue streams:	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles	Mosqoy Field School	Mosqoy Members	Mosqoy Youth Program alumni contributions

Casa Mosqoy
CASA MOSQOY	A Home away from home	Casa Mosqoy is a home away from home. Mosqoy Youth Program’s dormitory-style residence provides a place for students to live while enrolled in school, as well as a foundation for support, safety, and the acquisition of important life skills.	Many of our students come from difficult family backgrounds that range from poverty, domestic violence, alcoholism, and many other hardships; therefore, the safety and support provided by Casa Mosqoy is particularly important. For many students, Casa Mosqoy may be the first positive family environment they have experienced.	​	Life skills students learn while at Casa Mosqoy include maintenance of a clean living space, cooking, communal living, and conflict resolution. Casa Mosqoy is also where we facilitate our leadership program.	​	Workshops include:	​	Financial literacy	​	Employability	​	Effective and non-violent communication	​	Sexual and reproductive health	​	​	Nutrition and active lifestyle	​	Self-expression through art	​	In addition, we hold a number of social and community-building activities such as movie nights, holiday celebrations, and inter-cultural exchange evenings with local Spanish language schools.	​	The experiences provided by Casa Mosqoy, coupled with the formal education funded by	Mosqoy Youth Program	,	empower our students to become responsible, motivated, and culturally aware agents of change for their communities.

Ambassadorship
AMBASSADORSHIP	“Education is a luxury that not all people have easy access to. By bringing students from Peru to speak with Canadian youth, we are making a significant contribution to the education of both groups.”	– Graham Miles, Mosqoy Intern	Our student ambassadors travel to Canada biennially, allowing further opportunities for Peruvian students to gain valuable knowledge and professional skills.	​	What is an ambassadorship?	Mosqoy partners with the University of Victoria to send two of the most promising graduates from the Mosqoy Youth Program to Victoria, Canada, to give them the opportunity to learn valuable language and professional skills. While in Canada these students also raise awareness among a new generation of Canadians about Indigenous cultures and traditions, acting as Quechua cultural ambassadors.	Connecting with Canadians	During their stay, students attend English Second Language (ESL) classes at the University of Victoria, while living with Canadian homestay families. They also host presentations to local high schools and university classrooms, and participate in intercultural indigenous youth knowledge exchanges. This gives Canadian youth - including First Nations youth across British Columbia - the opportunity to learn about Quechua culture, international non-profit organizations, and some of the economic and social challenges that are now facing Peruvian youth.	Our 2012 Ambassadors, Ebhert and Elvira	Ebhert and Elvira are two Mosqoy Alumni who, through the Ambassadorship Program, travelled from Peru to Canada in the winter of 2012. Both were involved with Mosqoy since its inception in 2006. Since successfully graduating from their post-secondary studies, they have have shown inspirational dedication and integrity through their volunteer work as student leaders. We were excited to be able to select them as our student ambassadors in 2012.	While in Canada, Ebhert and Elvira attended ESL classes at the University of Victoria (UVic), which gave them a chance to practice their English skills and meet a number of international students from all over the globe. As they became more comfortable with their newly honed English skills, they began hosting a number of cultural exchange events including traditional Peruvian cooking classes, and presentations about Quechua culture and their lives in Peru.	Elvira’s Story	Hi, my name is Elvira. It has been a good experience studying English at UVic because every day I learned new words and culture. It was exciting. I learned a lot of English. Many people helped me. At UVic I had a class from 8:30-12:45. I was never absent from my class. Every day, I spoke English with everyone. I also learned that some people have a lot of money. It is amazing!	​	My experience in Victoria is wonderful because I learned about Canadian culture	and I saw the beautiful forest. I also learned about the daily life here. It is very different from Peru but I’m so happy because I could learn about Victoria and meet very good people. I’m lucky I also met volunteers who work for Mosqoy and Q’ente.	​	We participated in presentations at high schools and the university. I’m happy because I have talked about my life and my culture to almost 200 young Canadians. It was exciting because I used to be nervous speaking in front of an audience but now I’m not!	​	When people ask me about Peru or Indigenous communities, I’m really happy because they want to know about my culture. Thank-you to all the people who helped me. Now my dream is real. Thank-you, my time here has been great.	Ebhert's Story	Hello, my name is Ebhert Florentino. I arrived in Victoria on January 5th. I started to study at UVic on January 9th. I have had a nice experience here because I have learned a lot of English and I know new friends from other countries, for example Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Chile, China, Japan and many countries. I studied for 12 weeks and yesterday I had the final dinner with my friends and teachers. It was a nice dinner.	​	During my schedule in Victoria, every day I went to class. The class is in the morning from 8:30 until 12:45. On Saturday and Sunday, I went to play soccer with my new friends. Sometimes I went to a Mosqoy volunteer’s home to make food together or sometimes we went hiking in the mountains. I saw a hockey game and we also went to the opera and had many other activities at UVic.	​	I visited three high schools to explain about Mosqoy and Q’ente and I did one presentation at the First People’s House at UVic. In two weeks, I will go back to Peru, but I am very happy because I introduced many people here to the life in Peru and the difference between Peru and Canada.	​	Thank-you to everyone for everything and for the opportunity to come to Victoria and study at the university.

Alumni
Where are our ALUMNI now?	Over 70 alumni have graduated from the Mosqoy Youth Program since the first graduation ceremony in 2010. Here is a glimpse at a few of our alumni stories.	Carmen Mescco Uñapillco	Culinary Arts	Home Community:	Tanccac	Cohort:	5	​	Carmen graduated from Mosqoy’s scholarship program in 2016 with a Culinary Arts Degree from the Khipu Institute. In high school, she came from a family that could not provide her with financial or emotional support, so she began working as a waitress in a local restaurant to pay her own way through high school. Through this experience, her employers became her mentors, and she fell in love with the art of cooking. By the time she graduated, she knew she wanted to pursue culinary arts. Carmen was a shining light in Casa Mosqoy, with extreme discipline and ambition, and a true friend to her housemates during her three years in the program. Within less than a year of graduation, Carmen opened her very own restaurant in her hometown of Ollantaytambo, Apu Veronica (named for a sacred mountain that overlooks the town). Mosqoy is helping her with business advice and marketing, as she pursues this huge dream of hers. Carmen’s partner believed in her so much that he sold his car to take out a loan for her restaurant; they started with eight chairs and one table, and could barely make ends meet. Now, a year later, they have a continual stream of happy clientele, great reviews on Trip Advisor, and a beautiful baby girl, also named Veronica.	Lisbeth Monica Chavez Monge	Accounting	Home Community:	Ollantaytambo	Cohort:	3	​	Lisbeth was a member of our third cohort, and graduated from our program in 2012 with a degree in Accounting from the Khipu Institute in Cusco.

Upon graduation, she obtained a job as an accountant for a hotel outside of Machu Picchu, before being offered an Ambassadorship to study English for a semester at the University of Victoria in January 2016. During her time in Canada, she participated in an international Indigenous youth knowledge exchange, sharing her Quechua wisdom with Samburu youth from Kenya, as well as Nuxalk, Kwantlen, and Stölo First Nations youth. Upon her return to Peru, she was offered her dream job in the Finance Department of the Ollantaytambo Municipality, working for her home community.

He also worked as a communications assistant for Mosqoy in Peru between 2011-2012. Since finishing his program in Official Tour Guiding at the Americana Institute, Rolando worked for tour agencies, Tucano Reps and Puma Trek Peru, but has since founded his own agency called Willka Travel. Rolando hopes to work with Mosqoy by donating a portion of his travel agency’s revenues to the Andean Youth Program.

Elvira is from the	campesino	(rural subsistence farming) community of Tanccac, outside of Ollantaytambo. Her parents are both farmers, and she is the first professional of her family. She was a leader in Casa Mosqoy, and was one of the founding students, helping us establish the key values and norms that we still use for the T'ikary Youth Program. Upon graduation, she received a semester-long scholarship by the University of Victoria as a Mosqoy Ambassador to study English as a second language, while sharing her culture and experience with Canadian youth.

TEXTILES
Revitalizing Quechua culture. Empowering Quechua women.	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles is a community-based textile revitalization initiative that supports Indigenous Quechua weaving cooperatives in the Cusco region of Peru.	​	With the pull of consumerist desires for the cheapest textile, Quechua weavers today find themselves at a desperate crossroads: maintaining age-old weaving practices embedded with generations of knowledge appears to equate with a life lived in poverty, while achieving any hope of prospering economically calls for replacing weaving traditions with synthetic materials and homogenized, mass-produced designs.	Witnessing this urgent dilemma, Mosqoy aims to ensure the best of both worlds.	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles provides outlets for textiles to be sold at prices that are fair and reflective of the true labour, time, skills, and knowledge they entail. This serves to:	​	Channel 100% of the profits back into Quechua communities	​	​	Revitalize this invaluable textile tradition that spans millennia	​	Connect women's often unacknowledged labour with a fair income source, fostering financial independence in their families, greater provision for their children, and a central, respected place in the rural economy	​	​	Sustain a foundation for women voices, which sing themselves through the medium of the textile	​	Renew cultural pride and enhance the perceived worth of textiles in both Quechua and non-Quechua communities	​	​	Maintain the transmission of woven cultural symbols, which encode Quechua history, cosmology, identity, beliefs, and values, from generation to generation	About the textiles:	​	Products offered by	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles	are fairly traded with Indigenous weavers from the Cusco region of Peru. These textiles are made using traditional Indigenous Quechua weaving techniques, which have been practiced for centuries in the Andean mountains.	Textiles are all hand-woven on backstrap looms using only locally-sourced alpaca, baby alpaca, and sheep wool	dyed	with natural plant pigments	.	Quechua textiles are woven with beautiful patterns and symbols. Each weaving community works with a variety of symbols that represent vitally important aspects of everyday existence in the Andean mountains.	Symbols	relate to livelihood, tradition, knowledge, and well-being.	​	Traditional knowledge is required to carry out the steps of the weaving process, including shearing livestock, dyeing the fibre using natural plants, building the warp of the backstrap loom, and weaving the textile. This knowledge is grounded in Quechua tradition, language, environmental knowledge, and the geography of the Peruvian Andes. The loss of these rich weaving traditions due to pressures of globalization and the desire for inexpensive tourist commodities would result in the loss of this deep cultural knowledge.	​	To learn more about the Quechua textile tradition, check out	our products	.	Shop Textiles	Check out our	Etsy Store	​	Visit our	R	etail Outlets	​	​	Join us at upcoming Mosqoy textile fairs and	events	Our relationship with the weaving communities:	​	We work with weaving cooperatives in some of the most remote communities in the Sacred Valley and Mapacho River Valley regions. We currently work with the communities of Amaru, Huaran, Parobamba, Cancha Cancha, and Pitukiska.	​	With acute awareness of the tendency of charitable and aid organizations to further feed dependency cycles, Mosqoy takes careful steps to stimulate self-sustaining cycles of autonomy:	​	Mosqoy only partners with established autonomous weaving cooperatives, thereby building on the pre-existing capacity of these associations to sustain themselves.	​	Beyond purchasing textiles at sustainable prices that fairly compensate weavers for their efforts, Mosqoy's Q’ente Textile Program also helps weavers to learn business and financial skills, thus giving them the capacity to set up their own market outlets and work independently with other retailers without Mosqoy’s support in the future.	​	​	We provide networking opportunities for weavers from different communities to come together at our annual reunions to exchange knowledge and ideas about weaving processes, exhibit their products, and participate in multi-community capacity-building workshops.	​	​	We hold monthly textile meetings to consistently check in with weavers and purchase their products. These meetings are held in weavers’ communities in their language (as opposed to asking community representatives to hike long distances to meet us). Because representatives who have the means to travel out of communities are often men and/or those with Spanish language capacity and economic means, this ensures that we can connect directly with women weavers. To witness our journey to one of our partnering weaving communities, Parobamba,	watch this video	!	​	Many of the weavers with whom we work only speak Quechua. Therefore, we always bring Spanish-Quechua translators to community meetings. This serves to venerate the Quechua language with the esteem it warrants and allows Quechua women to participate equally in discussions without their voices being compromised.	The profit model:	​	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles works under a community-based framework and is informed by the voiced needs of Quechua communities. The profit model of this social enterprise has been designed accordingly:	​	In addition to paying weavers a fair-trade price for their work, all textile purchases include a donation to each weaving association’s	Community Development Fund	, which acts as a communal bank account to save for community-based socioeconomic development projects of their choosing.	​	​	The profit from the textile sales returns to Mosqoy, to invest in its operations and charitable program, the Mosqoy Youth Program, which provides post-secondary educational scholarships for promising youth from these and other communities in the Cusco region.	​	​	We buy textiles directly from the weavers; our weavers therefore always receive payment in full,	and the supply chain is reduced from producer to consumer.	100% of textile profits return to Quechua communities and a charitable youth scholarship program	Annual Weaving Encuentro:	Every spring, Mosqoy holds a weaving	encuentro	, or “meeting of weavers.” This is a fun, one-day event which allows members from each of our partnering weaving associations to gather together, share experiences, and learn from one another. The event is held at our field base in	Casita Huaran	. Activities include inter-community mingling, presentations from each of the weaving associations, a capacity-building workshop, and plenty of food!

Fair-Trade
Fair-Trade	Mosqoy buys textiles directly from Quechua weavers at fair-trade prices	and	abides by fair-trade principles.	Why Fair-Trade is important:	​	In Peru, Quechua communities transmit rich weaving knowledge from generation to generation to cultivate the classic Peruvian textiles that we admire and utilize, yet many Quechua communities in Peru do not receive a fair price for their textiles. Isolated rural communities lack direct market access, often selling their textiles below the cost of production to local middlemen. This destroys the social and cultural fabric of these communities. When Quechua communities in Peru suffer, the whole world suffers - from mass migration and overcrowding in cities, inferior quality products, loss of rich cultural knowledge and tradition, and environmental degradation.	Definition of Fair-Trade:	​	Fair-trade is a system that starts from the premise that workers’ lives have value; this social benefit is partly what you pay for when you buy something. Fair-trade doesn't just mean that farmers and producers receive more money, though that's vitally important. It also means that they work under long-term contracts so their communities have enough security to invest in improvements both to their businesses (with more land and animals, or better machinery) and their societies (with things like schools or health clinics). Typically, fair-trade producers are small cooperatives of workers using no child or forced labour, using organic or environmentally sustainable methods, and who have high standards of animal welfare. Workers are free to join unions and bargain collectively to help improve their lives.

Meet Our Weavers
MEET OUR WEAVERS	Cancha Cancha	Parobamba	Amaru	Huaran	Pitukiska	Cancha Cancha	Cancha Cancha	Alejandra Mamani Ccarhuani	Alejandra Mamani Ccarhuani is a member of Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1993, is married, and has two children. She went to primary school, but didn’t finish it. She speaks Quechua. Her main activity is weaving, while her husband is a subsistence farmer. Her family does not sell animals. Every three-four months, they go to Calca and Huaran to work in the fields or to sell herbs. They often don’t have enough food to feed everyone each day; sometimes they have enough to send children to school, but not always – her two daughters didn’t finish primary school. She and her husband decide together how the profit from her Q’ente textiles will be spent. She wants to be able to give her children education and everything else they need. She says her husband has more respect for her now that she is part of the project; if she wasn't making money, he would not have respect for her. She likes being part of the weaving association, because the women talk and work together.	Dorotea Quispe Hancco	Dorotea Quispe Hancco is Vice-President of Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1979, is married, and has four children. She has never gone to school. She speaks Quechua and understands a bit of Spanish. Her main activities are weaving and agriculture. Her husband works in agriculture and as a porter on the Inca Trail. Her family earns approximately 100-200 soles ($40-80 CAD) per month, though it varies from month to month. She spends the money that she makes from the Q’ente Textile Program on her children – on food, education, and medicine for them. She and her husband decide together how the money will be spent. The family always prioritizes their children’s education, even though they sometimes don't have enough to eat. They don't have electricity in their house. Her wishes for the future of her children are to help them buy land for a house, to help them study, and to help them with costs in general. She likes being part of the weaving association because everyone works together and talks to each other more often because of this. She feels better about life because she is part of the weaving association, since she now can support her family better. She also feels like she has more respect from others since she joined it.	Elena Mamani Ccarhuani	Elena Mamani Ccarhuani is a member of Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1995 and is single. She doesn’t have any children. She went to primary school, but didn’t finish it. She only speaks Quechua. Her main activities are weaving and subsistence farming. She still gets some help from her family, but often can't afford food. Sometimes she goes to work in the fields in Huaran and Calca, but only on rare occasions. She is happy to be part of the weaving association, because she is making her own money. She feels men respect women more when they are making money.	Juana Ccarhuani Ccorcca	Juana Ccarhuani Ccorcca is Treasurer of Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1973 and is married. She has eight children. Juana went to primary school, but didn’t finish it. She only speaks Quechua. Recently the Evangelical church in the community has been teaching them how to read some of the Bible, so she is learning how to read this way. Her day consists of weaving, subsistence farming, and raising animals. She also goes to work in the fields in Calca when her family doesn’t have enough food; she makes 20 soles ($8 CAD) per day working in those fields. She would like to be a full-time weaver in the future. Her husband is sick and cannot work. The family prioritizes their children’s education, even though they sometimes don't have enough to eat. Income from the Q’ente Textile Program represents almost half of the family’s income. With the money from it, she sometimes buys candles to light her house at night. They also now have a bit more access to the city because of profit from the Q’ente Textile Program. She decides how the money will be spent by herself, without her husband’s input. The busiest time of the year for her is during the potato harvest. She enjoys being part of the weaving association because they help each other, and talk to each other more. She says the future looks a bit better than it did before.	Lucia Sicos Mamani	Lucia Sicos Mamani is a member of Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1984, and is married with three children. She has completed some grades in primary school. She only speaks Quechua. Recently the Evangelical church has been teaching her community how to read the Bible and how to write. Her main activities are weaving and agriculture, though she would like to be a full-time weaver someday. The busiest time of year for her is the potato harvest. When the family doesn’t have enough food, her husband goes to work in the fields in Calca where he makes 25 soles ($10) per day. The majority of the money made from her Q’ente textiles goes towards her children's education. Sometimes her family does not have enough for food, but they always find money for education. She would like to be able to give her children the opportunity of a higher education, if possible. She feels better about herself since she started working with Mosqoy because she feels she is contributing to her family and children. She likes being part of the weaving association because all of the weavers are socializing and because she can help her family.	Lucia Ccarhuani Huaman	Lucia Ccarhuani Huaman is a member of Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1953 and is married. She has five children. Two of her daughters (Alejandra and Elena) are also part of the weaving association. She speaks Quechua, and never went to school. Her main activity is weaving, while her husband is a subsistence farmer. Every three-four months, her family goes to Calca and Huaran to work in the fields or to sell herbs. They don’t often have enough food to feed everyone. Sometimes they have enough to send their children to school, but not always. Two of her daughters didn’t finish primary school. She and her husband decide together how the money from her Q’ente textiles will be used. She says she likes weaving “because it's what I do, it's my life.” She likes being part of the weaving association because, as she says, she is not just waiting for the man to bring money home. She notices that men now have more respect for her.	Vicentina Quispe Ccorcca	Vicentina Quispe Ccorcca is President of	Illariy Ch’aska	, Cancha Cancha’s weaving association. She was born in 1972 and is married with six children. She never went to school. She speaks Quechua and understands a bit of Spanish. Her main activity is weaving. Her husband works in agriculture and as a porter on the Inca Trail. Her family makes approximately 120 soles (approximately $47 CAD) per month. Vicentina explains that, to cover all the basic expenses of the family, they would need double this income (approximately 300 soles per month). The profit she makes from her textiles is spent on food, education, electricity, transport, and medicine. She and her husband decide together how the money will be spent. The one thing she would like to give to her children that she currently cannot provide to them is the gift of education. She says that she feels more self-confident, calm, and happy since she started working with the Q’ente Textile Program.	Please reload	Huaran	Huaran	Andrés Sallo	Andres Sallo is the president of	Munay Urpi	, Huaran’s weaving association. He was born in 1973 and has three daughters, who all study in Huaran or Cusco. Andres learned to weave when he was 12 years old; his mother taught him because he loved the art so much. His wife and daughters all weave as well. He was born in the	campesino	community of Quncani, near Lares, but moved to Huaran in 2000 so that his daughters could continue studying. (Quncani only has an elementary school.) Andres speaks both Quechua and Spanish, and attended elementary school in Quncani until the fourth grade. He works as a porter on the Inca Trail and as a weaver; he also often meets retailers in Cusco on behalf of the	Munay Urpi	association. His favourite time of year is the corn season because “it is very beautiful.” He is impressed with how much his weaving cooperative has improved since they began in 2004; when they started, they never cleaned or washed their products, but now – primarily due to a capacitation workshop offered by	Casa Bartolomé de Las Casas	– they have improved their product standards considerably. Andres loves weaving	pasadizos	, and especially loves weaving the	lelli pallay	(the large diamonds in the center) because they are some of the most ancient designs that the great-grandparents have passed down. Andres explains that their ancestors would weave these designs in order to bring the harvest and pray for seed.	Bonifacia Condori Quispe	Bonifacia Condori Quispe is the vice-president of	Munay Urpi	, Huaran’s weaving association. She was born in 1973, and is married with three children. She was born in Huaran, and attended primary school but did not finish it. She speaks Quechua and a bit of Spanish. Her main activity is weaving, while her husband is a subsistence farmer. She makes approximately 250 soles ($96 CAD) per month, and doesn't know how much her husband makes. One of her children studies at Khipu Institute, a post-secondary institute that is very expensive, so she says it is a struggle to support him. They often do not have enough to eat, but she wants to be able to give her children an education. She appreciates that, since the formation of	Munay Urpi	, there is more unity. Before, she says that there was a lot of envy and the weavers were not helping each other – now they are. They realized that if we are united, they can get further towards their dreams together. She also notes that, before the association, she didn't have as much respect from her husband; now she feels she has more respect.	Concepción Hancco Sicos	Concepción Hancco Sicos is Treasurer of	Munay Urpi	, Huaran’s weaving cooperative. She was born in 1992; she has one child, and has a partner who she lives with. She graduated from secondary school, and is fluent in both Quechua and Spanish. Her main activity is weaving, as her family does not own a farm. She notes that her family was able to afford electricity after she started working with Mosqoy, but they still need more money to be able to plan for the future. For now, she feels that her child has what he needs. Concepción and her partner decide together how to spend the money that she earns from her Q’ente textile profit. She likes being part of	Munay Urpi	because “in union, there is strength.” She also likes that the weavers help each other finish their products, and that they always do everything in their power to finish all of the orders they receive from clients. She also appreciates that she does not have to travel to the city to sell her products, and leave her child alone.	Eufemia Landa	Coming Soon	Francisca Alagon Puma	Francisca Alagon Puma is member of Huaran’s weaving association. She was born in 1962, and is married with three children. She is from Accha Alta in the Lares district. She has never attended school and only speaks Quechua. She cannot read or write, but can sign her name. Her main activity is weaving. Her husband drives a	mototaxi	(a tuk-tuk or motorcycle taxi), works as a porter on the Inca Trail, and works on their farm. The family earns approximately 700-800 soles ($270-$310 CAD) per month. Her children are currently studying and working in Cusco city. Her wish is to be able to afford to go to the doctor when she needs to, and to have a full medical check-up so that she can figure out what is wrong with her body. She dreams big and believes this trait is why her children are reaching high for their futures (one is studying psychology at the national university, while another is studying accounting at a trade institute). She knows she is a good thinker and is always trying to help her children. She has to travel several hours to get to Huaran for the	Munay Urpi	meetings, but she feels that being part of this weaving association will give her new opportunities. In the past, she was selling by herself to tourists her were going to Lares. She now feels more secure because she has more guaranteed sales, which makes it easier to know how to plan and spend her funds.	Gregoria Mamani	Coming Soon	Hermenia Sallo Huaman	Coming Soon	Hilda Ttito Ocon	Coming Soon	Juana Paula Sicos	Juana Paula Sicos is the president of	Munay Urpi	. She is originally from the community of Quishuarani, but moved to Huaran in 2004, so that her children could go to school. She still returns to Quishuarani a lot to visit her family. Juana Paula has been weaving since she was five years old. Her mother died when she was very young, so she taught herself to weave by watching the other weavers in her community. She says it was hard to learn the ways of her community without a mother, and with a father who was absent a lot, but she and her six older siblings took care of each other and “more or less raised ourselves.” Juana Paula predicts that she knows 280 patterns. When asked if she know many ancient Inca designs, she said, “one adapts and changes the patterns according to personal taste.” Before working with Mosqoy, she worked with a wholesaler who ordered hundreds of weavings from her, but she saw very little profit from this work. With Mosqoy, she is able to spend more time with her family while still making a decent income. With her textile profit, she has built her house, fed and clothed her family, and given her children an education. Juana Paula says that her role as president has taught her how to lead and organize, and how to encourage others to work harder. She says that the weavers of	Munay Urpi	teach each other; while she has shared her knowledge, the other weavers have also been her teachers. There is a strong relationship of reciprocity between the weavers, she says.	Nelly Hancco Sicos	Nelly Hancco Sicos is a member of Huaran’s weaving association. She was born in 1994, and has one child. She graduated from secondary school, and is fluent in both Quechua and Spanish. Her main activity is weaving; her partner is a construction worker in Cusco city. She likes that	Munay Urpi	is well-organized: for example, they have a	multa	(fine) for those who do not attend the meetings, which works well. They also have a list that Mosqoy helped them create, which has allowed them to equitably distribute textile orders among their members. She says that this prevents fighting, and that they talk about problems and solve them together. Being part of the association gives Nelly a lot more motivation to work hard. She is excited that the municipality saw they can work well, and that – because of this – it helped them establish a connection with Marriot Hotel in Cusco, which is a new retailer of their products.	Rosa Hancco Sicos	Rosa Hancco Sicos is a member of	Munay Urpi	. She was born in 1982, and is married with two children. She finished primary school and some secondary school, but did not graduate. She speaks Quechua and a bit of Spanish. Her main activity is weaving. Her husband is a security guard at a school, and also works as a farmer. With the profits she receives from her textiles, she purchases wool to make more textiles. Because they don’t own their own animals nor have access to dye plants, they need to purchase their weaving materials; wool costs approximately 50 soles ($20 CAD) per cone. After purchasing these materials, there is not much money leftover. They don't always have enough to eat, nor to send their children to school. She would like to provide her family with more security and education. Rosa says that she would still like to learn more about	artesania	; for example, how to use a sewing machine. She likes that there is unity and confidence in	Munay Urpi	, and that the association is growing. “We used to be only three, now we are many,” she says.	Sabina Ccana Tacuri	Sabina Ccana Tacuri is a member of	Munay Urpi	, Huaran’s weaving association. She was born in 1965 and has five children – three boys and two girls. All of her children are now adults with their own families. Sabina was born in Amaru, but moved to Huaran with her husband because her community had no high school for their children. She speaks Quechua and a bit of Spanish, and never went to school. She spends most of her days weaving and taking care of her farm animals. She likes Huaran because it is warm and accessible, unlike her home community of Amaru, which she says is cold and remote. Sabina’s mother taught her to weave when she was 10 years old, mainly so that she could make her own clothing. Sabina likes to weave the small things the most –wallets, changepurses, bracelets. Her favourite symbol is the condor, and her favourite natural-dye colours are red, green, and mustard yellow. She uses the profit from her textiles to support her children to pay for their weddings. Sabina wishes that she had the funds to be able to cure her eyesight, because she now can no longer see very well.

Angela has three children – one son and two daughters. All of her children are studying. Angela's Husband, Gregorio Sotalero Tacuri, is the president of Amaru's weaving association. Angela attended Amaru’s only primary school until the 2nd grade, and only speaks Quechua. Her favourite designs to weave are symbols that depict different elements of the earth, like the river and the sun. She also loves the symbol,	Chilis Laraypa	, which is a calendar depicting the entire year, with each of the 12 months represented cyclically; lakes and trails are embedded within the calendar design. The Chilis Laraypa is a very complex design; to make one figure, 32 white threads and 32 red threads must be used, vertically and horizontally.	Gregoria Chipa Ccana	Gregoria Chipa Ccana is a member of the	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru.	She was born in Amaru in 1959. Gregoria has four sons. Her husband works as a farmer. Gregoria attended primary school until the 3rd grade, and speaks Quechua. An average day for Gregoria consists mainly of weaving. Gergoria’s favourite dye colour is blue, because it’s the most authentic representation of her community of Amaru. In the past 50 years, Gregoria has noticed a change in climatic phenomena – she says there are now abnormalities in the seasons, and crops now grow at different times. She has also noticed a change in the diet compared to when she was a child. Gregoria mentions that she never ate noodles as a child but now she does on a regular basis. “We only ate what was natural,” she says. “Bread was only for Christmas, but now it’s normal to find it in stores all the time.” Gregoria also notes that the children in Amaru do not dedicate time to weaving as much as they used to, due to a shift towards formal education, spending full days in school instead of with their families.	Gregorio Sotalero Tacuri	Gregorio Sotalero Tacuri is the president of the	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru	. Gregorio is also the father of three children and is married to weaving association member, Angela Ccana Zamata. As President, Gregorio constantly communicates with non-governmental organizations that work in the region, with the hope of bringing improvements to his village. His greatest accomplishments have been establishing a library and obtaining free medications for the local health clinic. The connections that he has built with other communities, tour agencies, and NGOs have allowed his weaving association to grow from a small cooperative to one that is highly sought after by retailers, with many sales opportunities in Cusco. Gregorio was also a signer in the	Parque de la Papa	agreements, as a representative for his community – a regional community-led campaign to ban GMOs and multinational organizations from working in their region. Gregorio learned his knowledge of agriculture, weaving, Inca culture, and indigenous medicine from his grandfather. Gregorio estimates that he knows about 70 or 80 traditional Incan weaving patterns, and he cares deeply about preserving the tradition of weaving.	Hermetania Huanca Ccana	Hermetania Huanca Ccana is a member of the	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru	. She was born in Amaru in 1970. Hermetania has five children, three girls and two boys. Her husband is an agricultural worker. Hermetania attended school until the 2nd grade. She speaks Quechua. An average day for Hermetania includes working on the farm and taking care of her animals. Hermetania learned to weave when she was eight years old because all of the other girls in her community were learning to weave. She first began learning to weave by making the	senkapa	(a traditional thin wrap, used to adorn hats and skirts). Hermetania says that children now do not learn to weave until they are around 12 or 13, since most children attend school and do not have time when they are younger. She loves to weave bracelets and scarves the most. Her favourite dye colour is purple because it allows symbols to stand out.	Paulina Ccana Condori	Paulina Ccana Condori is a member of the	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru.	She was born in Amaru in 1985. Paulina has three children, two boys and one girl. She attended school until the 6th grade, but had to stop since Amaru only has an elementary school and she completed the highest grade it had to offer. She speaks Quechua. An average day for Paulina depends on the season, but she is often found cooking or tending to her fields. Paulina has many animals, especially sheep. She mainly raises these animals so that she can use their wool as weaving material. Paulina weaves because she needs the money for her family, and to pay for medicine and her children’s education. She says that she enjoys being a part of the weaving association because it gives her more strength to continue weaving, especially when they have sales. Her favourite textiles to weave are scarves, and her favourite symbol to create is the snake because “Amaru” means “snake” in Quechua; it is therefore very symbolic for her community.	Rudecinda Huanca Ccana	Rudecinda Huanca Ccana is a member of the	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru	. She was born in Amaru in 1957. Rudecinda has four children, one daughter and three sons. All of her children are adults, and now have their own families. Her husband works as a farmer. Rudecinda attended primary school until the 3rd grade. She speaks Quechua. Rudecinda learned to weave when she was eight years old because all of the other girls in her community were learning to weaving; they did so together in a very systematic way. She and her community peers began learning by making	senkapas	(traditional long strands, used as wristwraps nowadays, but more traditional used to adorn hats and hair). The senkapa is still Rudecinda favourite textile to weave. Her favourite dye colours are burgundy and charcoal; she tries to put these two colours in all of her textiles.

She was born in 1991 and has four children. Alfonsa attended school until the 4th grade. She speaks Quechua, and can read a bit, but cannot write. Her grandmother taught her how to weave when she was 12 years old. Her favourite dye colour is light blue and her favourite textile symbol is the	pika	. Her favourite thing about being part of the weaving association is that she gets to weave with others and share knowledge. Alfonsa weaves in order to sell her textiles and to help her children. She buys yarn and pays for her children’s education with her textile profit. Her husband works in agriculture and as a porter on the Inca Trail. Her dream is to improve her family’s house.	Bonifacia Quispe Mendoza	Bonifacia Quispe Mendoza is a member of Pitukiska’s weaving association. She has six children and a husband who works cultivating potatoes and cutting wood for her household. When Bonifacia was six years old, she developed an interest in weaving as she observed all of her community elders practicing the art. She especially likes to weave	chullos	(toques), and her favourite symbols to weave are animals and hearts. She was born in Pitukiska and has lived in this community all her life. Bonifacia attended school for one year and only speaks Quechua. Her favourite thing about her weaving association is that she can be with her fellow weavers and that she always learns something new in each meeting.

She never attended school but enjoys sharing the traditional knowledge she holds with other weavers in the association. She does not like the city; instead, she enjoys walking in nature and spinning yarn in her community.

Although born in Pitukiska, Juana attended school in Bombom until the third grade. She only speaks Quechua. She learned to weave when she was very young, so that she could keep herself warm. Her favourite product to weave is the	chullo	(toque). She had a serious accident many years ago that damaged her nerves, and says that she does not remember things very well. She is feeling better now that her textiles are being bought by Q’ente, because she is learning how to better sell her weavings and her husband is now not the only one working. Juana’s favourite symbols to weave are the	q’ente	(hummingbird) and the llama.	Lucia Pilco Huahuasoncco	Coming Soon	Lucia Quispe Mamani	Coming Soon	Martha Illa Rojo	Coming soon	Maruja Illa Leon	Maruja Illa Leon is the secretary of Pitukiska’s weaving association. She was born in 1990, and is married with two children. She went to primary school but did not finish it. She speaks Quechua. She can read a bit, but cannot write. Her husband is sick and therefore cannot work, so her weavings are their family’s only income. She spends her textile profit on food. She was able to pay part of the expenses for her husband's medical treatment with income from Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles, while the other part came from their health insurance. She is feeling happier now because she is making more money, and because their church is guiding them, so she feels safer.

An average day for Melchor includes working as a porter for the Inca Trail, making textiles, and selling his bracelets at markets in the city. His favourite part of Pitukiska are the beautiful mountains and the natural landscape. Melchor mentions that a challenge he sees in his community is that there is less work for men than for women. “Men can only work in the farm,” he says, “while women have many roles. They can raise sheep, maintain the family, or weave.” Melchor was taught to weave by his mother when he was a little boy. He mentions that, while it is rare for boys to weave, he always liked helping his mom and always loved the textiles, so his mother finally decided to teach him. Melchor’s favourite textile to weave is a bedspread. His favourite designs to weave are the	uña de llama	(llama's claw) and the	mayu q'enqo	(river in zig-zag formation). Melchor weaves because it is a tradition that his ancestors passed down to him; he weaves so that he does not lose those memories. Melchor says that he is in the association because: “we work, we weave, we don’t forget.” Melchor hopes that in the future his community will improve the quality of their textiles and their houses, and be able to offer	turismo vivencial	.

Moises Quispe Mendoza	Coming soon	Narcisa Quispe Rojo	Narcisa Quispe Rojo is originally from Bombom, where her father is the president of his community’s weaving association. She came to Pitukiska because she met Melchor (also a member of the weaving association), who is now her husband.

She and Melchor first met at the annual	Carnaval	, which the communities of Bombom and Pitukiska celebrate together. She has lived in Pitukiska since 1997 when they first met; however, they recently moved to Amparaes so that their youngest son, David, would have better access to education. Narcisa dreams that her children will become master weavers (with a father and a husband who are presidents of their respective weaving associations, it's quite likely!), as well as professionals (such as guides, lawyers, or engineers). For herself, Narcisa dreams of selling her textiles in a little shop of her own someday. Because she learned to weave from her grandmother, Narcisa knows many traditional and ancient Inca designs; she estimates that she knows about 40 different patterns.

Celestina continues to weave because it provides her with an economy, which she uses to help educate her children.

Cipriana Chipa Huahuasoncco	Cipriana Chipa Huahuasoncco is a member of Parobamba’s weaving association. She was born in 1974 and has six children – four girls and two boys.

Her favourite color is orange, her favourite flowers are margaritas, and her favourite food is river trout.

She likes to be involved in the weaving association because she has the opportunity to sell her own weavings, and to put her own creativity into her textiles. Before working with Mosqoy’s Q’ente Textile Program, Cipriana was unable to sell any textiles because of the remoteness of her community, but since working with Mosqoy she has been able to buy tools, care for her children, and support her family. In the future, Cipriana wants to continue weaving and to see her kids have a bright future. She hopes that her children can choose who they want to become.

She was born in Parobamba in 1971, is married, and has nine children. Her oldest child was born in 1990 and her youngest in 2015. Dina completed primary school, and speaks both Spanish and Quechua. Her main activity is weaving. Her husband works in agriculture and sometimes sells animals. Every two or three months, he sells an animal for about 800-1000 soles ($310-390 CAD). She says her family does not get sick, so they do not need to go to a doctor; they take care of all of their health needs with herbs that grow around Parobamba. They always have enough to eat, because they own a field and grow their own food. If her husband had a job, he wouldn't be able to take care of the field, so she is content with their current circumstance. Dina learned to weave when she was 20 years old, and was taught by her husband in fear that their weaving culture was being lost. She continues to weave so that she can give her family a better life. Dina likes the Q’ente Textile Program because its representatives come every month to the community and talk to all of the weavers; she also feels that there is a feeling of security. Also, Dina says that Q’ente is the only project that pays for products upfront. When the weavers worked with other organizations and individuals in the past, representatives often only talked to the president, rather than including everyone in the conversation. Dina says she would miss the textile orders that the Q'ente Textile Program makes if Mosqoy did not continue; especially when there is a big order, it is a large part of her family's income, which is spent on electricity and education for her children. She wants all of her children to achieve higher education. She feels much calmer, more respected, and happier because she has a job. Before, she didn't feel like she was respected. Dina wants the world to know that it is important for her to keep traditional weaving culture alive, and she wants people to respect and accept the work.

Throughout her years living in Parobamba, Jeronima has noticed the number of houses increasing. She is very happy to live where she does and, even though her community lives in the highlands, it has access to different ecologies where they can grow a variety of different fruits and vegetables.

Juana loves to weave all textiles but her favourite symbol is the	q’ente	(hummingbird). Her favourite dye colours are black and orange. Juana weaves so that she can pay for her children’s education and so that she can buy foods that are not typically offered in Parobamba. She would like the world to know that people in highland communities struggle with not being able to officially own the land or property they occupy. In the future, Juana hopes that more people will learn about traditional Peruvian textile weavings and that she can keep selling her products in an effort to give her children a higher education.

Leonarda would like to find a way for her textile products to make a better profit, which matched the hard work that she puts into them. She wants the world to understand how much work goes into each weaving and why the cost is so high. Partly because of income from the Q’ente Textile Program, Leonarda’s family recently had enough money for some renovations on their house. She and her husband mutually decide how to spend the money that she earns from her Q’ente textiles. She would like to make sure all of her children have higher education.

She also takes care of her aging parents, as well as her sister and baby niece, both of whom have special needs. Maria learned to weave as a small child, taught by her mother and grandmother. She wasn't in school, so she needed an activity to do. She continues to weave because she can create beautiful colours and patterns in her clothing. Her favourite product to weave is the traditional shawl. She uses her profits to buy products such as rice, sugar, and salt. She prefers to weave big symbols as she can see them easier, due to her poor eyesight. She faces many challenges, including her many competing tasks, her aging body, and the pains in her arms and shoulders from weaving for so many years. Maria wants the world to know that she desires to “rest in peace,” since her body no longer works as it once did and she is in pain. She is very tired, going blind, and believes she will only have rest once she has passed on. In the Andes, death is simply a part of life, and the next natural step when one is ready; it is the process of stepping into another world.	Maria Magdalena Vargas Ttupa	Maria Magdalena Vargas Ttupa is President of Parobamba’s	Nueva Esperanza Weaving Association	. She was born in 1971 and has four children, three girls and one boy. Her youngest daughter has Down’s Syndrome. Her husband is a construction worker and farmer. Maria was born on a mountain near Parobamba, and went to primary school until the second grade. She speaks Quechua and a bit of Spanish. An average day for Maria involves weaving, and taking care of her family and animals. Maria weaves because she doesn't want her family or kids to miss out on things, and because it is the only way to have an economy in her community. Everything else in Parobamba is accessed through	ayni	, methods of reciprocity or exchange. Her mother and grandmother taught her how to weave when she was 15 years old. Maria enjoys being part of	Nueva Esperanza	because she is able to weave with her friends and sell her textiles. Maria’s favourite products to weave are the	pasadizo	and poncho. Her favourite symbols to depict in her textiles are the mountains and	chullpas	of Parobamba. Maria loves to naturally dye all different colours, but prefers light blue, yellow, and green the most. When Maria was a child, she says there were few houses in Parobamba, but now there are many houses and a road. Also, the rooftops are now made of tin instead of straw. Maria notes that, although there is not enough money or work in her community, there is a lot of competency and skill in weaving. In the future, Maria would like to own an artisanal store where she can sell products, or run a restaurant where she can cook for visitors. As one of her hopes for the future, she hopes that her community works on cleaning up the environment.	Roxana Huahuasoncco Vargas	Roxana Huahuasoncco Vargas is a member of Parobamba’s weaving association. She was born in Parobamba in 1991. Roxana has one son and one daughter. Her oldest child is studying and her husband works as a farmer. Roxana completed primary school and attended the first year of secondary school in Parobamba. She speaks Quechua and some Spanish. Roxana’s average day includes weaving and taking care of her baby. Roxana likes being part of the weaving association because she gets to be with her peers, and makes money to spend on food and her children’s education. Her favourite products to weave are	chalinas	, ponchos, and	pasadizos	. Her favourite symbols are animals and mountains. Her favourite dye colours are light blue, yellow, and green. She learned to weave at age 12 because her mother thought it was an important part of their culture to pass on. Roxana is excited for the construction of their weaving center so that she can sell her textiles there. She notices that, compared to when she was a little girl, there are now more cars and stores in Parobamba. She says that “there isn't much work here, and the government doesn't help us improve our work situation or our education. I've been wanting to work on the land for a long time, but the government won't let me own land. In Parobamba, there isn’t good teaching, so my kids will turn out just like me. Instead, I want them to go to school in Calca, so they have a better education and more opportunities.”	Salomé Vargas Ttupa	Salomé Vargas Ttupa is a member of the	Nueva Esperanza Weaving Association	. She was born in 1951 and has six children, four boys and two girls. Salomé was born in Parobamba and attended first grade at the local primary school. She only speaks Quechua. Her mother taught her how to weave when she was very young so that she could keep herself sheltered from the cold. Salomé’s favourite thing about the weaving association is that she gets to have company while weaving. Her favourite textile to weave is the	pasadizo	(tablerunner) and her favourite textile symbols are the llama’s paw print and pick-axe for cultivating. Salomé loves dyeing her own fibre and enjoys combining different dye colours. Salomé weaves to take care of the health of her family, as well as to offer her children a chance at formal education. Her husband also works as a farmer to support the family. Salomé remembers when she was a kid that only three families lived in Parobamba. All of the houses converted from straw roofs to tin roofs over time. She also recalls that there used to be a lot of forest surrounding Parobamba, but over time the trees have been cut down and replaced by houses.	Yovana Chino Condori	Yovana Chino Condori is a member of the	Nueva Esperanza Weaving Association	. She was born in 1965 and has four children – three girls and one boy. She had her first child at age 17. Her three daughters are working and have families, and her son is studying. Yovana is a single mother. She was born in Bombom but moved to Parobamba in 1994 to be with her now ex-husband. Yovana did not attend school, since there were no schools close enough to her hometown of Bombom. She only speaks Quechua. Yovana spends her days weaving and enjoys being a member of	Nueva Esperanza	because she gets to be with her peers. Her favourite textiles to weave are ponchos and	pasadizos	. Yovana’s favourite symbols are hummingbirds and doves, and her favourite dye colours are light blue and green. She uses the profit from her textiles to buy yarn for future projects and to buy food. Yovana learnt how to weave when she was 12 years old by watching other weavers. Her mother did not know how to weave.	Please reload

Weaving Communities
WEAVING COMMUNITIES	Cancha Cancha	Illariy Ch’aska	This remote community is located on the Lares Valley route, approximately nine kilometers up the mountain from the Sacred Valley (approximately three-four hours of uphill hiking). It is located in a very mountainous area, at the foot of a glacier with six lakes surrounding it, at an altitude of 4100 m. Currently, the community is only accessible by foot. Drinking water comes from an aquifer (though must be boiled to be potable) and water for irrigation comes from rivers supplied by glacier lakes. There is no electricity; however, electricity poles have been hand-carried up the mountain over the past two years, and have recently been installed with the hope of electricity in the near future.	​	Cancha Cancha is an agricultural and weaving community. Due to its high elevation, potatoes are the main crop. The community shares three collective greenhouses where vegetables are grown, but this does not produce a sufficient amount of food to feed everyone. Other resources include native trees such as qaunia and cacha conqo. The	plants they use for dyeing include panti, chiri chiri, ccumu ccumu, q'eto, chunkay, and huarmi. The community is very committed to conserving naturally grown plants and sustainable forms of harvesting.	​	The traditional way of life is still very strong in Cancha Cancha; whilst students often learn in Spanish they are deeply committed to the heritage of the Quechua language. The community often makes offerings to the earth and animals with coca, wheat, fruits, and flowers. They also value	ayni	, which is the Andean tradition of reciprocity. The weaving heritage is strong within Cancha Cancha and they have been partnering with Mosqoy since 2009. Passing on the weaving tradition is deemed important as they do not want Incan traditions to be lost. Cancha Cancha is Mosqoy’s only partner community that still raises and shears alpacas as one of its primary practices, and which hand-spins its own alpaca fibre as a proud part of its textile tradition.	Huaran	Munay Urpi	Huaran is a rural village located along the main Sacred Valley route. The weaving association,	Munay Urpi	, meets together regularly to weave and develop dyeing skills on the side of the road.	​	The weaving tradition in Huaran has not been as strong as other communities due to its accessibility and modern influences. However, it has been revitalized here through teaching from other local communities a few years ago; they have been working with Mosqoy since 2009. Nobody in the community owns their own alpacas, but some families have sheep, and they often buy or trade wool from Calca and Urubamba. The association is well known for creating beautiful bags that are popular at Mosqoy’s trade fairs, and for designing their own innovative modern products. In the future, they hope to acquire their own plot of land along the main road, allowing tourists to visit the community.	​	Since working with	Munay Urpi	in 2009, Mosqoy has seen the association grow from a fledgling unofficial group of friends who wished to improve their weaving abilities to a legal entity that is well organized, with inspiring leadership that hosts regular meetings and which produces high-class textiles - both traditional and fusion - that are being commissioned by consumers and retailers regionally and internationally.	Amaru	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru	Amaru	​is a community located 30 km north of the tourist town of Pisac, in the province of Calca. Amaru is a sustainable farming community whose motto is to reciprocate back to Mother Earth who gave it life. With their textile profits, community members have cured cataracts in elders and implemented nutrition programs with youth. They have also improved sanitation for all community members by constructing compostable toilets.	​	The main jobs within this community are construction, agriculture, and textile fabrication. The natural plants they use for dyeing wool are colle, chilca, quinua, eucalyptus, and checche, as well as many varieties of flowers. The association has a plant garden in which it grows various species of dye and medicinal plants.	Pitukiska	Mayu Ch’aska	Pitukiska is the most isolated and impoverished community that Mosqoy works with. Accessible only by foot, houses are spread over a large area of agricultural land, set amongst several mountain peaks. Their weaving association’s name,	Mayu Ch’aska	(meaning “River Star”), was chosen in part because of the river that flows through the community and the abundance of stars that they are able to see at night. There is no electricity or potable water.	​	Most of the community members own their own sheep and alpacas. Men are primarily employed in agriculture, while women work in textiles. The weaving association regularly meets in the open space beside the greenhouse, with children as young as 10 learning the textile tradition. There is a nearby elementary school with 50 students; however, the closest secondary school is in Parobamba, approximately four hours away by foot, each way.	​	Community members most enjoy working in the fields and raising animals, the clean air, and the pristine environment which they enjoy taking care of. The people of Pitukiska like the tranquility of their community, and enjoy living in the countryside, raising animals, and their ability to make products off the land.	Parobamba	Nueva Esperanza	Parobamba has been working with Mosqoy since 2009. The weaving tradition is very strong here with most children learning the tradition around the age of 13, often due to personal choice and interest.	​	Parobamba is part of a fragile ecological zone, so all crops and vegetables are grown organically and fertilized with sheep and guinea pig manure. The community buys most of its wool and alpaca fibre from the nearby community of Inka Cancha.	​	The community’s location is particularly noteworthy, as it is on the very edge of the last Andean mountains, bordering the Amazon’s Cloud Forest and Manu National Park, a biosphere reserve on the edge of the Peruvian rainforest. It is maybe for this reason that the textiles of this area are characterized by bright, tropical colours, including shades of turquoise, bright greens, and pinks. The community is currently struggling with the implementation of a Canadian copper mine just below it, which has drastically changed the community and affected access to its natural resources.	​	Mosqoy is currently helping the Parobamba weaving association build a communal weaving centre, a dye plant garden, and plant conservation area, with financial aid by McGill University’s SLA Summit.

==============================
Textile Symbols
TEXTILE SYMBOLS	The following are a few symbols found in weavings from our partnering communities. Often, the meanings of these symbols vary from community to community, and from weaver to weaver, since this tradition is transmitted orally from generation to generation. These symbols provide a snapshot of some of the elements of the Andean natural environment that are important to Quechua culture.	​	We recognize the knowledge of the Quechua weavers who shared the above information with Mosqoy staff and volunteers Ashli Akins, Sarah Confer, Rose Prieto, and Alison Root (among others), and especially the master weavers Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, Gregorio Sotalero Tacuri, and Daniel Soncco, whose knowledge of Quechua textile iconography- and dissemination of such knowledge - is tantamount.	Condor	In the Incan Trilogy, the condor is the God of the Upper World. A sighting of a condor is thought to be a message from the heavens, often a message that someone has recently passed away. Stories have also been told of condors helping people find their way when lost. The message that the condor conveys differs from community to community.	Puma's Claw	The hook-like marking in this image is the symbol for the puma’s claw. In the Incan Trilogy, the puma is known as the God of the Middle World, or physical earth. The puma is also known as the cougar or mountain lion in some communities.	Puma's Tail	The brown weaving in this image is the puma's tail. When woven in textiles it is used to represent the presence and importance of the puma, the God of the Middle World.	Puma's Paw Print	The puma's paw print represents where the puma, God of the Middle World or Earth, has once been. The puma is an important figure in many weaving communities, as it is one of the gods in the Incan Trilogy.	Inti	Inti is known as the Sun God in Incan beliefs. The Sun God, like all of the other gods and goddesses, is based on an element of nature, such as its apposite symbol, the moon mother, Mama Quilla. Inti is believed to be the god that looks over and takes care of people on earth. It is common for boys in Peru to be named after the Sun God, Inti, while girls are named after the moon goddess, Quilla.	Chakana	The Chakana is a significant religious symbol for many Quechua communities. The Chakana is often referred to as the Inca Cross.  Each corner and side of the Chakana has a meaning, such as values, seasons, and gods. The Chakana is also a star constellation easily seen from Andean mountains.	Potato Flower	The potato flower, when used as a symbol in textiles, is to demonstrate the dependency on potatoes within the Andes. There are over 2400 types of potatoes grown in Peru, many of which are heirloom varieties. In many communities, potatoes are the only crops that can be grown, due to the high altitude and harsh climate; some children have only ever eaten a potato. Laws have been passed in some areas, such as in the Parque de la Papa (Potato Park) where the community of Amaru is located, which keep corporations from commercializing heirloom potatoes and from introducing genetically modified potato strains.	Wheel of the Six Fertile Lands	This hexagon represents the six key crops that Quechua people must learn to grow and cultivate year-round to be able to subsist off the harsh lands of the Andes. This wheel includes quinoa, corn, quiwicha, potato, and two other grains.	Branches	This symbol can often be found running along the sides of long textiles, such as a tusuy (undyed table runner) or a qolla (undyed scarf).	Hearts	A weaving of a whole heart symbolizes love. Quilts woven with this symbol are often given as wedding gifts. Whole hearts on a textile can also mean that the person who wove that item is married. Alternatively, if there is a half-heart symbol on a textile it often means that the weaver is single.	Hummingbirds	The "Q'ente," two hummingbirds feeding one another, is a symbol for reciprocity, love, and nurturing. It is often featured on blankets from mother to child, or on wedding quilts. It is also a symbol for revitalization, and rebirth for new life. It is one of the most important symbols of Andean textiles. In the Incan Trilogy, a single hummingbird is thought to be a messenger between the three worlds- upper, middle, and underworld.	Llama	Llamas, being one of the four camelids of the Andes, are often represented as symbols on larger textiles. This is because a llama can be used in many important ways to support Andean livelihoods. Llamas are often raised for their fibre to create textiles, and for their meat. They are also used to carry cargo across vast mountain ranges.	Viscacha	The Viscacha is a large rodent that can be found in the Andes. The Viscacha is in the same family as the chinchilla.	Book	The book is an interesting symbol. At one point in time this symbol was used to represent an instrument of some sort, possibly a harp or guitar, but as years have passed this symbol has changed its meaning to show the importance of education in Quechua communities. This image shows an open and closed book.	Lake	All diamonds symbolize lakes. If there is something inside the diamond, it means the lake is healthy and ready for harvest. This symbol represents the importance of water for life and subsistence.	Waves	Waves on a textile symbolize water. Water is a significant part of Quechua culture as it is thought to be the creator of life. Symbols of waves are meant to show the importance of life.	Steps and Trails	The white zig-zag line in this image symbolizes a trail, often the Inca Trail from Cusco City to Machu Picchu. The black stripes surrounding the trail symbol are used to represent Incan steps made out of carved stones.	X's and O's	This symbol is a practice symbol. It is the first symbol that a beginner weaver is taught how to create. "X’s and O’s" is used as a teaching method because it is such a basic symbol compared to others. Once a person learns how to correctly create X’s and O’s they can then move on to more difficult designs.	Please reload
==============================
Natural Dyes
NATURAL DYES	Quechua textiles are dyed using native plants and other elements of the Andean	ecosystem.	The following are some of the key dyes used in these textiles.	​	We recognize the knowledge of the many Quechua weavers who shared the above information with the following Mosqoy staff and volunteers: Rose Prieto, Sarah Confer, Katie Larone, Leah Hughes, and Ashli Akins (among others). We especially would like to recognize the knowledge of Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, Daniel Soncco, and the women weavers of the Nueva Esperanza Weaving Association of Parobamba, whose knowledge of natural textile dyes - and dissemination of such knowledge - is tantamount.	Chapi	Galium aparine l.	Produces the following colours: Orange, red-orange, and coral	​	Chapi is a vine-like plant that produces fruit in August and September. The long, thick stems of the vine are collected, but only the bark is used for dyeing. Chapi is a relative of the European dye plant, madder.	​	Chapi is known to be particularly lightfast. Chapi stems are harvested, dried, and crushed to be used when dyeing. The bark is then soaked overnight before being used in dye batches.	Cochineal	Dactylopius coccus	Produces the following colours: Red, pink, orange, purple, grey	​	Cochineal is a scaled insect that can be found inhabiting Tuna Cacti throughout Peru, particularly along the dry southern coast, as well as in the Sacred Valley of Cusco. Cochineal can produce 20 different tonalities of colour. These include blood red, orange-red, fuchsia, shades of pink, purple, lilac, and lead grey. Cochineal has even been said to produce shades of blue.	​	The cochineal beetle is often used as a natural dye because, when crushed or boiled, the beetle produces vibrant colours. Once harvested by hand the small insects are then laid out in the sun to be dried and then ground up before the dyeing process begins. Cochineal is added to the dye bath just before the water begins to boil.	​	Cochineal has a PH of 5.5 and therefore requires fixatives. It has poorer resistance to light and moisture compared to other dyes, and will fade or change colour over time. The initial colour achieved when using cochineal depends more on the type and amount of the fixative used rather than the amount of cochineal used.	​	Cochineal is rare and hard to cultivate. Therefore, red yarns are much more expensive, and are increasing in cost annually.	Ch'illca	Baccharis caespitosa	Produces the following colour: Dark green	​	Ch’illca is a common plant found throughout the Cusco region. The plant grows near the edges	of streams and around farmers' fields. These bushes can grow to be about 1-2 meters tall.	There are two varieties of the ch’illca plant, one with a straight smooth edge, and one with a	serrated edge; the straight-edged plant produces a green colour. Ch’illca thrives nearly year-	round.	​	Fresh ch’illca leaves are stripped from their stalks, ripped into small pieces and added directly	to the dye bath when the water is near boiling. Ch’illca is a weak dye, which means that	approximately 1 kilogram of ch’illca is required to dye 2 kilograms of wool. When dyed by	itself ch’illca produces a very dark emerald green. Ch’illca is often dyed with ñuñunka to create	a light green.	Mote Mote	Vaccinium Floribundum Kunth	Produces the following colours: Dull red and burgundy	​	Mote mote is a small deep red fruit that is dried up and ground to achieve a burgundy or dull red when naturally dyeing wool. This plant grows at altitudes of approximately 2500 to 3000 meters in the mountains of Andean jungles.	Thiri	Miconia spp.	Produces the following colour: Orange-red	​	Thiri is a green plant whose leaves are used when dyeing to produce an orange-red dye. The flowers that thiri blooms can also be used to produce a purple colour. This plant grows at altitudes of approximately 3500 meters. Thiri leaves are harvested year-round, but the flowers are only harvested from February to March.	​	Thiri is often combined with q'olle to produce a shade of yellow.	Yanali	Bocconia frutescens	Produces the following colour: Mustard yellow	​	Yanali is a slow-growing, lanky tree that grows in the Mapacho River Valley. It is a very unassuming tree, but when the outer bark is chipped away, it reveals an intensely bright orange inner bark. Branches of this tree are harvested after the tree bears fruit, anytime between March and September.	​	After the outer bark is removed, the freshest parts of the orange inner bark are chipped into small pieces. These are added to the dye bath once the water is already boiled. Yanali, much like kinsa k’uchu, does not require a mineral fixative due to its acidity.	Awaypilli	Iresine diffusa	Produces the following colour: Purple	​	These leaves create a purple colour when used to dye.	Kinsa K'uchu	Baccharis genistelloides	Produces the following colours: Pale blue, turquoise, teal, light blue	​	The name kinsa k’uchu means “three corners” in Quechua. This name is due to the shape of the leaf, which is composed of three flat sections radiating out from a central axis. It is particularly found at middle altitudes in the Mapacho River Valley, bordering the edge of the jungle. Locals from communities in this area, such as Parobamba and Bombon, walk down hillsides looking for this characteristic plant.	​	The tri-cornered leaves grow in clusters, straight up from the root, reaching a height of about a third of a meter. It can be harvested at any point during the year.	​	Only leaves that have been affected by a black fungus are collected for dyeing. It is not the plant itself but a fungus that grows on kinsa k’uchu that provides dye colours. Since kinsa k’uchu has a natural PH of 2.5 it does not need further fixing since the acidity of the leaf acts as a fixative. Leaves must be dried and ground before being used. 4 kilograms of fresh kinsa k’uchu leaves turns into approximately 1 kilogram of dried leaves. Dried leaves are added to the dye pot before the water boils.	Q’olle	Buddleja coriacea	Produces the following colour: Yellow	​	Q’olle is a small, yellow flower that is very commonly used within the Sacred Valley area of Cusco. When used to dye materials, q’olle produces a bright, vibrant yellow.	​	Q’olle grows in altitudes as high as 3400 meters. These bunches of flowers are collected for dyeing between the months of February and April.	​	Q’olle has no known medicinal uses but it is a melliferous plant (it produces honey).	Ñuñunka	Solanum nitidum	Produces the following colour: Bright yellow and used to lighten other dye batches	​	Ñuñunka grows at altitudes of approximately 3500-3600 meters within the Peruvian Andeas and is harvested from March to May. Ñuñunka leaves produce a bright yellow but are often added to other dye batches such as ch’illca to lighten the colour.	​	Ñuñunka leaves are used fresh when dyeing and must be added to the pot before the water boils. Fixatives such as alum and table salt are often added to these dye batches.	​	Animals often eat ñuñunka to combat stomach viruses.	Please reload
==============================
Community Projects
COMMUNITY Development PROJECTS	Using the profit earned from Q’ente’s textile sales, we help coordinate projects in each of the communities, which are designed to help improve the quality of life in the community or to help the weaving association accomplish its goals.	​	Q’ente facilitates a number of projects and initiatives that support communities in the Peruvian Andes to revitalize their traditional cultural practices while sustaining their economy and the environment. Some community development projects we have supported include:	Nueva Esperanza Weaving Centre, Parobamba (2016-)	With funding from SLA Summit, a conference at McGill University focusing on social entrepreneurship in Latin America, Mosqoy has partnered with	Nueva Esperanza	(Parobamba’s Weaving Association) to purchase land and build a communal weaving centre. Here, the weavers can spin, dye, and weave year-round away from the harsh elements, as well as receive guests and tourists to host workshops and sell their textiles directly. In this space,	Nueva Esperanza	is also creating a propagation garden for important dye plants of the region that are becoming increasingly challenging to access in the wild. The project began in 2016 and is currently in development.	Image by Jérémie Pierre	Solar-powered lights, Mapacho River Valley (2013)	With financial support from US Aid, interested families in Parobamba, Bombom, and Pitukiska received solar-operated lights and chargers at highly subsidized rates.	Elementary school library, Q’enqo	(2011-2013)	Renovation of an existing building in the community of Q’enqo was carried out by a team of Mosqoy scholarship students. Once the space was renovated and furnished, it was ready to receive books! The inauguration of the library was on March 5th, 2012. It now serves as a library, classroom, and dining hall for the students of Q’enqo’s elementary school, depending on the time of day and day of the week, as well as the local tutors available to staff the library. Funding for this project was obtained through an amazing relationship with a group of grade three students at Battalion Park School in Calgary, Alberta.	Qenqo Library	Legal registration (2012)	Several of the weaving communities we partner with do not have access to legal registration, due to language, educational, and economic barriers, as well as transportation difficulties. Legal registration as a community	asociación	is highly valuable for weaving cooperatives, especially those whose primary membership are women, because it allows members to vote on community matters, apply for funding, and sell products directly without intermediaries. Essentially, registration empowers women with more power and voice, and gives those who are part of the association more autonomy and financial independence. Mosqoy held community workshops in 2012 to explain the legal process and answer questions, then spent the following year acting as the legal intermediary, working with community members and lawyers to register each weaving association that was interested in registration. Mosqoy continues to aid each of its partnering associations with maintenance of legal registration and questions regarding legal needs.	Kitchen & toilet improvements, Amaru (2011)	Amaru is a community 40 kilometers above Pisac, in an anti-GMO region known as Parque de la Papa. Amaru has successfully established a community-based	turismo vivencial	(experiential tourism) system. The profits from Amaru’s textile sales were invested to improve kitchens for the weavers’ houses, with proper ventilation systems to reduce pulmonary disease, and to purchase dishes and cupboards for families participating in the	turismo vivencial	program. Additionally, profits from the weavings contributed to building compostable toilets for several members of the association.	Optometry campaign, Mapacho River Valley (2010)	Community members in the Mapacho River Valley (Parobamba, Bombom, and Pitukiska) who experienced problems with their eyes or eyesight were taken to a non-profit clinic in the Sacred Valley where they each had their eyes examined by volunteer optometrists at the	Kausay Wasi Health Clinic	, based in Coya, Peru. Each person who needed them received a pair of reading glasses and sunglasses, and one woman received further treatment for a more serious eye condition.	Floor Looms, Amaru (2007)	Amaru wished to purchase floor looms to weave some larger products that do not require fine designs (i.e. carpets), thus giving weavers more time to dedicate to the finer quality weavings that require backstrap looms. This adaptation of the weaving tradition was a choice by the community members, which they felt would aid in the revitalization and continuance of their weaving tradition, especially given increased pressures and demands on their time.

WORKSHOPS & TOURS
travel with Mosqoy	At Mosqoy we offer field schools and tours that empower people to become more conscious consumers and responsible travellers. We aim to encourage travellers to understand their impact on the communities they visit while inspiring them to think compassionately and critically about international development issues through experiential education.	​	Our field schools and tours work directly with local communities in the Andean mountains of Peru, with 100% of the profits returning to local community members and Mosqoy's	charitable programs.	Field schools	are designed for high-school and university student groups to take their	curriculum outside of the classroom and into the Andean mountains, for two or more weeks at	a time.	Tours	, on the other hand, are open to travellers of all ages who are interested in	learning more about Indigenous communities, sustainable travel, and responsible	consumption. We host half-day, one-day, and two-day tours, as well as all-inclusive multi-week	tours.	​	Mosqoy Field School uniquely caters each program based on participants' needs. However, we generally follow a four-part structure:	​	Responsible tourism	, visiting iconic sites of Peru's Sacred Valley while employing local youth as guides and translators, and supporting local reputable businesses;	​	​	Cultural immersion	, learning from community members about their lifestyles, traditions, and landscapes, through traditional meals, visits to family homes, and Indigenous weaving expositions;	​	Service learning	, working directly with Mosqoy's charitable programs to provide a needed service or skill-set that will leave a legacy long after the program concludes; and	​	Adventure trek	, summiting an Andean mountain, to conclude the program with a physical manifestation of the participants' challenges, moments of inquiry, and sense of accomplishments.	We provide preparatory workshop materials to ensure that you are well equipped for your program; these materials include information on packing, health and safety concerns, cultural sensitivities, as well as supplementary thematic readings.	Mosqoy Field School budgets vary based on the length of tour, and standard of meals and accommodation requested by the partner. We aim to base all tours on the same general itinerary, but each group can include or exclude activities, based on their interests, budget, and time limits.	​	Please contact	fieldschool@mosqoy.org	for more information.

At Mosqoy we focus on the importance of responsible and sustainable tourism. Our goal is to empower people to become more conscious consumers and responsible travellers. We strive to encourage students to understand their impact on the communities they visit while inspiring them to think compassionately and critically about international development issues through experiential education.	​	Each tour can range from 10 days to thee weeks and is uniquely shaped to match the interests of each school. We collaborate with you. To keep aligned with our values we make sure to employ local youth as guides and translators while on excursions, and that we support local	reputable	businesses when dining and shopping. Mosqoy Field School budgets vary based on the length of tour, and standard of meals and accommodation requested by the school.	​	Read an account of Mosqoy's first field school	here	.

For example, an environmental studies class would perhaps work towards setting up a composting system, or a propagation dye garden in one of the weaving communities.	​	Note:	We cannot promise that your trip will include a service project. If our charitable programs and/or partnering communities do not have a service opportunity that is truly deemed important and necessary at the time of your trip and in line with your participants’ skill levels, we will find more suitable activities for your program. This is because we strongly discourage	voluntourism	, and refuse to be part of this rapidly growing and destructive industry. We instead will only support service projects that positively impact the communities that we work with.	Fundraising:	​	Please note that all students are required to fundraise a minimum of $500 CAD for Mosqoy, which will be used for either a) their Service Learning Project or b) as a direct donation to Mosqoy’s charitable programs.	100% of funds are returned to local community members and Mosqoy's charitable programs.	​	Students will have a chance to visit and learn about the programs they fundraised for while on their trip.

(The students' intellectual property will be credited in all future references.)	​	While some academic research is desired by community members to assist in various arenas, local traditional knowledge is uniquely powerful though often undervalued. During the field course, community members will act as experts and teachers to respectfully share elements of their traditional knowledge with students, as a means to deepen students' understanding of Quechua relationships with the land and Andean cultural realities.	All university field courses will be co-taught by the interested professor(s) and Ashli Akins, Mosqoy's founder and president, who is a PhD candidate specializing in international human rights, intangible cultural heritage, and community-based development, with over a decade of expertise in the Andean region.

Our Team
OUR TEAM	Staff & Volunteers	Board of Directors Canada	Board of Directors Peru	Translators	Anchor 1	STAFF & VOLUNTEERS	Cusi Saco Chung	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles Manager	Cusco, Peru	Her parents gave her a Quechua name, which means “joy”, creating her first true connection with Quechua Culture. Cusi grew up in Cusco, and after school she moved to Lima where she graduated from business school. Nevertheless, her passion was fashion. Her entrepreneurial spirit has allowed her to implement the first fashion start-up in young executive fashion, which she ran in Lima for four years. In 2015, she received a scholarship and moved to Spain to specialize in Fashion Management at IED Barcelona. This Master’s degree helped her to gain more knowledge about the fashion industry and introduced her to new movements in sustainable fashion.	After a great experience in Barcelona, Cusi decided to come back to Peru with a clear goal: build a better and stronger textile fashion industry, helping entrepreneurs to add value to their products. This is the reason why, after working two years with a Peruvian textile enterprise, she decided to move back to Cusco and start her work with Mosqoy. She fell in love with Mosqoy’s projects and was drawn to the opportunity of working with Quechua communities, providing better opportunities to weavers, and working together on improving and selling their beautiful textiles and products. In her free time, Cusi enjoys walking through the streets discovering colours, textures, and trends. She also loves to travel and recently found a likeness to decorating spaces.	Carmen Trigoso	Lima Sales Facilitator	Lima, Peru	Carmen fell in love with nonprofit organizations when she was attending high school in Peru. She developed a deep passion for charitable work and organized programs at her school that aimed to provide equal opportunities for women. When she was 16 years old she received a scholarship and moved to the U.S. to attend college in Iowa. Carmen gained experience as a manager at Forever 21, which encouraged her to open her own retail store upon her return to Peru. She recently found in Mosqoy a true inspiration and is excited to contribute to Mosqoy’s vision. Currently she builds and maintains relationships with partner retail outlets in Lima and manages the online Etsy store (her favorite part of her job!). Carmen is also a digital geek and certified data analyst; in her free time she mentors young women who are entering the tech industry.	Anshela Paravecino Kehuarucho	Cross-Program Community Facilitator	Cusco, Peru	Anshela is Mosqoy’s cross-program community facilitator. She works as a liaison with all of our partnering communities to build and maintain positive working relationships, and to communicate effectively in both Quechua and Spanish. Additionally, she is supporting Mosqoy’s founder, Ashli Akins, as her doctoral research assistant, and through this role, is learning the ins and outs of raising alpacas (when not cuddling baby animals). Anshela is from the rural community of Juyhuay, in Yanatile, which is a sub-tropical zone of the Andes, known for its abundant cultivation of coffee and avocado. Her family runs a small but productive farm in the region.	Anshela is an anthropologist, who studied at the National University in Cusco. She is excited to continue pursuing her career path in the anthropology of development, and sees Mosqoy as a step in this lifelong learning journey. She loves her work as Mosqoy’s community facilitator because she enjoys spending time with community members in their own spaces and supporting them in their development efforts. Her values of learning, listening, and respect are reflected in her daily actions, and make her such a positive addition to the Mosqoy family. Her next personal life goal is to master Muay Thai.	Beth Delaplain (née Luque Huanca)	Mosqoy Peruvian Textile Fellow	Cusco, Peru	Originally from Cusco, Beth grew up in the United States with her adoptive family. In 2011, after years of hoping to travel to Peru, she embarked on a journey to find her birth family. Against all odds, she found them, and they welcomed her with open-arms and taught her about her indigenous ancestry. Since then, Beth has not only immersed herself in Peruvian culture, but has researched both Peruvian material culture (primarily textiles) and intangible cultural heritage. This eventually led her to the University of Oxford, where she received a master’s degree in Visual, Material and Museum Anthropology in 2018. Her passion for Peruvian textiles and the textile revitalization movement has led her to Mosqoy, where she plans to work with the weaving communities to help secure better opportunities for the artisans and their families. Her main goal is to ensure that the next generation continues to take pride in their traditions by bringing value and prestige to the art of weaving within Quechua communities. In her free time, Beth likes to explore new places, cook (and eat), and spend time with her family.	Alicia Cristina Gallardo	Translator Coordinator	New York, USA	Alicia Cristina was born and raised in Peru and is now living and exploring the city of New York as she attends NYU’s School of Professional Studies.

Carly is especially excited to be volunteering on RAVEN Trust’s Development Committee.	Levin Chamberlain	Grant Writer	Vancouver, Canada	Levin was born and raised in the southern interior rainforest of British Columbia. Before completing his Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Studies and History at the University of Victoria, his passion for indigenous rights and environmental justice propelled him to get involved with Mosqoy. After two internships in Victoria and Peru, Levin is truly grateful to still be working with Mosqoy, an organization that has deep connections to his values. The lovely and supportive community is now an integral part of his life goal to open a research station focusing on ecoforestry, permaculture design, and cultural revitalization in the traditional, unceded territory of the Secwépemc people. If you have troubles contacting him, he is most likely rock climbing, touring by bike, or studying plants in beautiful forests, all without cell service, so please do not call search and rescue… yet.	Charlotte Lee	Grant Writer	Victoria, Canada	Charlotte is a recent graduate of the University of Victoria's Health Information Science program. While completing her studies, she developed a strong passion for social justice and curiosity in meaningful social change. She is very interested in and passionate about indigenous rights, feminism, environmentalism and sustainability, and policy.

She hopes volunteering with Mosqoy will help her with her lifelong goal to learn and grow as an ally.	​	Her hobbies include camping, reading, exploring cities through their cafes, taking walks through neighbourhoods, and writing. She also has a strong life for patterned socks, the Oxford comma, and boats.	Kate Korte	Marketing Coordinator	Victoria, Canada	Kate is in the final year of her undergraduate degree in Political Science at the	University of Victoria. She is curious about the social complexities of our time and	has taken interest in feminism, immigration, and social media during her studies.	Before she came to Victoria, Kate spent six months studying abroad at the University	of Essex.	Her love for travel then took her to Thailand and Bali last year, where she saw some	of the negative impacts of unsustainable tourism firsthand. Although she has not yet	been to Peru, she was drawn to Mosqoy because she shares the organization’s	values and knows the importance of sustainable tourism practices. She strives to	continuously learn through engaging with the world around her and looks for	opportunities to make meaningful contributions to her local and global community.	In her spare time, Kate enjoys reading, jogging, and painting.	Justine Ethier	Education Facilitator	Victoria, Canada	Justine was born and raised in Victoria, B.C and is now attending the University of	Victoria as a student in third year. Her academic passions are in Indigenous Studies,	Spanish, and History throughout North and South America. Her travels to the	countries of Guatemala, Mexico, and Nicaragua led her to her passion of wanting to	master the Spanish language.	She started with Mosqoy in June 2019 as an intern. She was attracted to Mosqoy’s	passion for culture and community building, and her work as the Education	Facilitator allows her give back to the Victoria community and learn from the	communities Mosqoy works with in Peru. She believes that listening to others is the	key to building strong relations with people around the world and Mosqoy	encourages her to build these relationships.

He finds volunteering and serving to be a great way to meet new people and give back to the community. In addition, Hamid finds freedom in serving others and not asking for anything in return.

Robyn Traynor	Editor	Halifax, Canada	Robyn lives in Halifax, NS, where, if she could, she would eat oysters everyday. She likes running before the sun rises, experiencing new places through their local dining establishments, and reading. She reads everything. When she was little, she proudly announced to her mother that when she grew up, she wanted to "be a book". She is still working towards this sufficiently vague goal. Robyn recently took up stand-up paddleboarding after watching a short film of her favourite travel writer who paddle from Vancouver to Victoria simply because he could. She now spends most evenings gingerly paddling among the sailboats and cruise ships bobbing around the Halifax harbour.	Robyn currently works as a health research consultant where she facilitates collaboration between knowledge producers and knowledge users, bridging these two surprisingly distinct worlds to help them speak each others' language. In this light, she is excited to volunteer for Mosqoy, which itself is a truly inspirational example of community engagement.

This active engagement in community opened her eyes – and heart – to the power of meaningful relationships that we have with others, the environment, and ourselves. Lisa believes she can learn a lot from Mosqoy’s values and community approaches. In her spare time Lisa enjoys being creative through calligraphy, ukulele, and watercolours.

In Memoriam
In Memoriam	Frida Delgado Chirinos	Frida Delgado Chirinos was a Mosqoy volunteer, friend, and supporter - an energetic, positive, and caring person who worked tirelessly to help others. She was a cornerstone of Huaran and its surrounding villages. On December 1st, 2010, she was tragically killed by a reckless driver while walking to her home in rural Huaran.	​	When Mosqoy volunteers worked in the area, Frida took us in to live at her house and often accompanied us to weaving communities and meetings. She was our first connection to our weaving partners in Cancha Cancha and Huaran, and continued to act as their facilitator and Quechua-Spanish translator. She was eager to increase her involvement with the Q’ente Textile Program in 2011, both as a board member and as the host of a future Mosqoy research institute.	​	She was very active in the community of Huaran, continually working to improve conditions and employment opportunities for community members. Near the time of her death, she was organizing a medical campaign to visit the surrounding Indigenous communities of Huaran. In addition, she took in many orphaned and abandoned children, as well as single mothers, who lived with her.	​	At the time of Frida’s death, Mosqoy volunteers Sarah and Jose Luis were living with her, as well as the Cancha Cancha weaving association’s former president, Victoria. Allie, a Mosqoy field volunteer, remembers “how excited Frida was cooking with us when we were there, and showing us around her lovely garden. She was so jolly and fun to be around.”	​	Frida will be dearly missed by many people, including her three daughters and son, husband, extended family, community, and friends. In honour of Frida, we launched a scholarship in her name in 2011. Luzmila Quispe Hancco, a disadvantaged but promising young woman from Cancha Cancha who Frida knew since she was little and helped to raise, was the first recipient of this scholarship, realizing a dream that Frida had been envisioning for years. Luzmila graduated with a culinary arts degree in 2014. We continue to work closely with Frida's daughters, Tania, Naywa, and Urpi, at their community house, Casa Huaran, to host	encuentros	(weaving reunions), workshops, and field tours. Additionally, Naywa is a member of our Peru Board of Directors. We also continue to reserve one position for deserving youth from Huaran or Cancha Cancha in our annual selection process for the T'ikary Youth Program scholarships.	Georgia Klap	Georgia Klap was a volunteer and friend of Mosqoy until her untimely passing in 2013. She joined the Mosqoy UVic Club in her first year of university in 2010, and brightened the organization with her passion, critical insight, and positive energy. Georgia was known in her community as a changemaker; she was outspoken about social and environmental injustices and issues close to her heart. Before bringing her love of nature to her Environmental Studies education at the University of Victoria, she attended the International Youth Initiative Program in Sweden, the COP15 Climate Summit in Copenhagen, volunteered at an orphanage in a township in Capetown, and lived in Mexico and Canada along the way.	With integrity, respect, and a strong sense of justice, she lived out her beliefs in social action for the causes she valued. She was a loving, creative, thoughtful, and wise spirit who made a positive impact on everyone she knew. Her loss has been strongly felt by all of the communities she was a part of during her 23 years, and her memory lives on as a source of inspiration and motivation for many people in the Mosqoy community and around the world.	Wenceslau Ccana Ccana	In 2011, Mosqoy lost a dear friend, Wenceslau Ccana Ccana, who was a dedicated weaver, father, husband, and hard-working community member of Amaru. He was one of only two men who were part of the	Asociación de Tejedores Tradicionales Laraypas Indígenas de Amaru	, and was a skilled weaver and spinner who actively participated in and contributed to the weaving cooperative’s meetings and events.	​	Wenceslau was the caring father of T’ikary Youth Program student, Irene. After his passing she wrote, “We miss him very much. He has left a huge void in my family. We miss his wise advice, his moral help, and his love."	A former Mosqoy team member, Sarah Confer, also wrote, “Each time I arrived in Amaru, I was greeted by Wenceslau’s smiling face. He was the epitome of hospitality, always doing his best to make me feel at home. Wenceslau took his role as vice-president of the weaving association very seriously, and worked hard to make the association successful and have a real impact on the lives of his fellow weavers.”	​	Near his death, Wenceslau acted as a great support in a community	faena	, repairing many of his neighbours’ houses and his community bridge, which collapsed after the horrific April 2010 flood that hit his town. He sadly passed away in 2011 after battling cancer. He will be especially remembered for his contagious smile, warm and welcoming personality, helpful character, and famous beard.	Please reload

We can then ensure that it has been received. ¡Gracias!	Dear Mosqoy Family,	We are excited to once again announce the kick off of our Annual Giving Campaign! As we move forward into 2025, we reflect on all the ways youth bring passion and innovation into their vision for the future, investing in progress for the years ahead and tackling some of humanity’s greatest challenges. In many ways, our future relies on our youth!	​	Here at Mosqoy, we believe in youth, and are grateful for the opportunity to witness firsthand their successes. With the support of the	Mosqoy Youth Program	and our donors over the years, students have pursued careers such as Environmental Engineering, Education, and Business (and many more!) - making their dreams and aspirations come true with a little help from people like you.	​	Since 2006, your gifts have truly been an investment into the future, showing returns of a better world -	supporting Quechua youth who have the capacity, values, and desire to be the future leaders for their communities’ needs and priorities.	You are making that difference happen.	Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!	​	In addition to Mosqoy’s Youth Program,	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles	is gearing up for additional growth, working towards the revitalization of a vital part of Peruvian culture. Textile revenue for 2024 may surpass any other year previous (wow!) and we intend for that growth to bolster the success of our scholarship students, both current and future - as well as our partnering artisans, their families, and communities. This program is proving that economic and cultural resilience can indeed support one another.	And once again,	you	are making that happen	.	Thank you!	​	Our successes in 2024 are also thanks to our incredible team in Cusco (a staff of four Quechua leaders). Our team offers on-the-ground leadership by managing the students’ education, health, and housing, as well as our ongoing relationships with our partner weavers and retailers to continue building our Textiles program in a sustainable way. And additional fundraising is ongoing! Just this season we have been busy with events such as:	Raffle, in collaboration with local tourism businesses across Cusco and the Sacred Valley	Two Yard Sales and Community Fairs in Casa Mosqoy	UVic Annual Textile Fair	Participation in VIDEA’s Fair-Trade Fair	Photography Workshop for Travelers, led by Ashli in Cusco, Peru	Two “Introduction to Photography” workshops , led by Ashli in Cusco, Peru (in Spanish)	​	And so, we are launching Mosqoy’s 2025 Annual Giving Campaign, with high hopes of sustaining the good work of Mosqoy in Peru, to continue to provide housing, tuition, wrap-around support, and food for our scholarship students. Last year, your gifts through the Annual Giving Campaign	were enough to cover all of our students’ tuition costs not covered by other grants, donations, and fundraising!	It truly is an investment in the future.	​	This year we have a fundraising goal of	$20,000	, reachable with your continued support. With matching donations from the Board of Directors,	your donation will be doubled	up to the first $17,500, helping your gift go that extra mile! ​	We are a registered Canadian charitable organization (#839145414RR0001), so all Canadian donors will receive a tax receipt.	​	Please join in and give whatever you are able to reach our goal. No gift is too big or too small, as every contribution will continue to foster hope and aspiration for the students of Mosqoy and its partnering weavers.	thank you. merci. gracias. sullpayki.

Photo Gallery	STUDENTS AND CASA MOSQOY	Mosqoy's	T'ikary Youth Program	works with promising students from rural communities of the Peruvian Andes. By working with the T'ikary Youth Program these students have the opportunity to further their education, strengthen their leadership skills, and initiate change in their communities. While enrolled in their studies, students reside at	Casa Mosqoy	, a home away from home.	TEXTILES AND WEAVING COMMUNITIES	Mosqoy works with weaving cooperatives in some of the most remote communities in the Sacred Valley and Mapacho River Valley regions. All	Mosqoy Peruvian Textiles	are handcrafted by talented Indigenous Quechua weavers. The rich weaving traditions of these textiles use fibres and dyes from the natural mountain environment and are woven with intricate symbols that represent important elements of the Quechua culture.	STUDENT FAMILY HOMES AND COMMUNITIES	Strong family connection is a prominent value in Quechua culture. Our	T'ikary	students come from a number of communities located in the Peruvian Andes. When enrolled in their studies, T'ikary students stay at our residence home,	Casa Mosqoy	, with the ambition to return to their family communities with new-found skills and experience.	2018 Do Day	2018DoDay	On DoDay 2018, students from the Huaran High School (Sacred Valley – Cusco – Peru) took part in DoDay. In the morning students took part in workshops that brought attention to the importance of keeping a clean community and how to reduce plastic consumption. The students then collected litter from around the school and launched a Facebook campaign on how to reduce plastics. In the afternoon, members from different NGO’s and tourism businesses took part in the workshops to share their concerns and challenges on reducing plastic pollution. The members then implemented the long term action, “la Red por un Cusco Sostenible” or Network for a sustainable Cusco.	2016 Gala: Decade of Dreams	2016 gala album	Held at the Empress' Crystal Ballroom in Victoria, BC, we celebrated our 10th Year Anniversary with over 100 guests at "Decade of Dreams," featuring a four-course sustainable dinner, silent auction with over 40 local businesses, fair-trade textile sale, and keynote speech by Canadian author, Ronald Wright.	100% of profits raised during this event went directly to Mosqoy's charitable programs, to maintain and improve the work we do.	10th year ani party	10th Year	Anniversary	Party	We held a community celebration at the	Salon Comunal	in Ollantaytambo (where Mosqoy started 10 years prior), to celebrate Mosqoy's birthday - July 22nd! Mosqoy's alumni from several generations reunited to join us in the celebration, along with their families and friends, our partnering weavers, volunteers, community leaders, other NGO friends and supporters, and many community members!	2016 AMBASSADORSHIP	Mosqoy was thrilled to have T'ikary graduates, Lisbeth and Adrian, visit Canada in 2016 as a part of our	A	mbassadorship Program	.	While on their trip Lisbeth and Adrian were able to explore different parts of Victoria and Vancouver, complete an English course at UVic, and share stories of their cultural traditions from their home communities.	2016 Brentwood Field school tour	In 2016, students of Brentwood College School joined Mosqoy on a	Field School Tour	in Peru! While travelling students got to experience Quechua culture, explore the magnificent Andes, and learn the importance of sustainable tourism.	2014 Gala	2014 Gala: Resilience	The 2014 Gala was Mosqoy's first Biennial Gala. The night included a presentation from keynote speaker, National Geographic explorer-in-residence, Wade Davis, a four-course sustainable dinner, and extraordinary artwork for purchase, with over 200 guests. 100% of profits raised during this event went directly to Mosqoy's charitable programs, to maintain and improve the work we do.	2014 Brentwood field school tour	Brentwood College School took part in their first	Mosqoy Field School	tour in 2014. Students travelled to Peru to experience all that it has to offer, keeping in mind the values Mosqoy holds for sustainable tourism. Check out this	blog post	to hear more about their trip.	BIBLIOTECA Q'ENQO	Biblioteca Q'enqo allows young students in the rural town of Q'enqo access to Spanish reading material and encourages excitement for learning. Biblioteca Q'enqo was funded by the grade three classes of Battalion Park School (2011-2015) in Calgary, Alberta. Mosqoy students and volunteers created the library in an unused classroom beside Q'enqo's elementary school.	Read here	to see the excitement that Bilioteca Q'enqo instils in Peruvian youth and adults alike. To read about the grade three experiences from the Battalion Park School check out their	blog posts	.	2011 Weaving Encuentro	2011 WEAVING ENCUENTRO	The Weaving Encuentro is an annual uniting of Mosqoy's weaving communities. We invite partnering community members together in order to stimulate active discussion between communities and to share the year's most exciting events, learnings, and successes.	2010 GRADUATION	2010 grad album	T'ikary students' 2010 graduation was Mosqoy's first graduation ceremony. This day celebrates students as they complete the T'ikary Youth Program. We wish them well as they go on to explore new careers and contribute to the communities they were raised in.	2006 commencement	2006 COMMENCEMENT	In 2006 Mosqoy held its commencement ceremony on July 22nd. The ceremony was held at Museo CATCCO in the town of Ollantaytambo. This ceremony brought together students and family members to celebrate the inauguration of Mosqoy as an organization!
